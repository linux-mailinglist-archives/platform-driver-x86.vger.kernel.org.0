It is a port of the closed and open tools in Windows LenovoLegionToolkit, Vantage, LegionFanControl. I am testing it on different laptops with the help of a forum/chat and its working quite good.

As you say there is almost 0 code re-use so I don't think that
adding this to ideapad_laptop.c is worth the trouble, ideapad_laptop.c
already is big enough as is.

I do see that you bind to the PNP0C09 or VPC2004 device. Since you
poke the EC RAM and don't make any ACPI calls AFAICT it would be
best to just create your own lenovo_legion platform_device to
bind to, using platform_create_bundle() which will create
a platform_device + platform_driver for you in one go.

This will avoid conflicts with other drivers binding to
the VPC2004 device such as ideapad_laptop.

And you can then also specify the used superio mem or io-ports
as resources (and claim then in your probe()) so that these
properly show up in /proc/ioports and so that conflicts
with other drivers also banging on these ports get detected.

These addresses sometimes change at boot-time when different BIOS
options are enabled/disabled so I would advice against
hardcoding them.

Have you looked in:

sudo cat /proc/iomem

To see if the range is perhaps known to the kernel somehow already ?

I wonder if these ports are not already in use by some other driver
causing possible conflicts. Are they not listed in "sudo cat /proc/ioports" /

Ok, so lets see of we can figure out a better way to get the EC
memory address and if not I guess outb/inb it is.

From the sound of it we should definitely use this new methods
on these newer models, this should protect us against the
EC RAM layout changing.  This might be best done in separate
driver, that depends on how much code we can re-use if we
put support for the new models inside the same driver.

Hans
