Interesting, this sounds as if Windows is doing something which causes them to
all send the same scancode.

If the device has a removable battery, or an option in the BIOS to disable the
internal battery for long term storage (it will get re-enabled when you plug
in a charger then), it would be good if you can either remove the battery or
use the BIOS option; and then after that boot directly into Linux. I'm guessing /
hoping that that will fix things.

This is not really a good / usable workaround but it would be in interesting
data point.

If the battery is not removable; and there is no BIOS option, you could disable
the emergency shutdown on low battery behavior on Linux and let the battery be
drained until the battery-management-controller turns the machine off, that
hopefully has the same result.

Regards,

Hans
