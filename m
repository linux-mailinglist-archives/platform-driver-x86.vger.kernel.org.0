Since it seems that people are using a patched version of
the pcengines-apu driver with openwrt on newer models I would assume
that the answer here is: "No the ACPI code does not lock the IO space"
although it is unclear to me how the ACPI code exposes leds at all ?

Later in the thread you write that they do some hacks to expose
all io-space of the FCH as gpios and then presumably the embed
devicetree-bits pointing to those new GPIOs into ACPI to make
the leds-gpio.c code handle the LEDs ?

Note that making applications work OOTB on newer platforms is nice
to have, but is not specifically a blocker from the upstream kernel
review pov.  Userspace needing to adjust to e.g. /dev/sda becoming
/dev/nvme is not considerer userspace API breakage and this is
more or less the same.

Still I agree that preserving the userspace API across different
board models is something which we want to do if possible.

I agree that if the LEDs have the same function as before the name should
be preserved to not needlessly make life harder for userspace consumers
of these LEDs.

Hans
