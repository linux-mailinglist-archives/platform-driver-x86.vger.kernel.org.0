This change dramatically increase memory usage. I guess other that
maintainers would not like such change.

Also it seems that this change is not complete. It looks like that you
map two different scancodes (0x48 and 0x50) to same keycodes, moreover
both are unknown.

Could you please describe which key presses (or events) generate
delivering these WMI scancode events?

Note that purpose of printing unknown/unrecognized keys messages is to
inform that current pressed key was not processed or that it was
ignored.

For me it looks like this just just hide information that key was not
processed correctly as this change does not implement correct processing
of this key.

Also, could you share documentation about these 0x48/0x50 events? Or it
is under NDA?
