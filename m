Well, that was what caused part of my confusion / uncertainty here as
I could see that aux bus between these two drivers. Obviously, it's not=20
there currently but conceptually this relationship looks what full-blown=20
aux bus was supposed to solve.

The other part was that as per Greg's simple classification, certainly=20
this driver needs to access platform resources. BUT, that access is routed=
=20
through another driver which is a case his answer/classification did not=20
cover.

Okay. In part, this was also to check whether replacing full-blown aux bus=
=20
with faux should be considered another kind of "abuse". I've no problem=20
with accepting faux for cases like this as I see these as policy /=20
convention decision more than one being right and another wrong. :-)

Thanks to all who answered.
