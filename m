Changes in v3:
 - implement file naming as suggested by Andy Shevchenko
 - Removed documentation as not required
 - Added date to Makefile for improved clarity on split
 - Cosmetic clean ups.

Changes in v2:
 - Rebased to Linus's latest as requested
 - Updated documentation reference
 - Updated MAINTAINER file
 - Removed X86_PLATFORM_DRIVERS_LENOVO as I was worried about
   maintaining backwards compatibility for the distros.
 - Removed 2nd patch in series splitting out hkeys. That will be for
   the future

-	  If this option is enabled, ThinkPad-ACPI will export an ALSA card
-	  with a single read-only mixer control, which should be used for
-	  on-screen-display feedback purposes by the Desktop Environment.
-
-	  Optionally, the driver will also allow software control (the
-	  ALSA mixer will be made read-write).  Please refer to the driver
-	  documentation for details.

-

-config THINKPAD_ACPI_HOTKEY_POLL

-	  need to do NVRAM polling to support any of the hot keys you use,
-	  unselecting this option will save about 1kB of memory.
-
-	  ThinkPads T40 and newer, R52 and newer, and X31 and newer are
-	  unlikely to need NVRAM polling in their latest BIOS versions.
-
-	  NVRAM polling can detect at most the following keys: ThinkPad/Access
-	  IBM, Zoom, Switch Display (fn+F7), ThinkLight, Volume up/down/mute,
-	  Brightness up/down, Display Expand (fn+F8), Hibernate (fn+F12).
