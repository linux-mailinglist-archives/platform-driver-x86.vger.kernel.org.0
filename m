Hmm, maybe no. There's no chance to call memblock_reserve() after 
memblock_free_late().

I suggested making change in efi_free_boot_services() because the
similar problem has been encountered by Andy himself and fixed in
efi_free_boot_services(). Please check below commit for reference.
The patch described the phenemenon, while explained why in code
comment.

commit 5bc653b7318217c54244a14f248f1f07abe0a865
Author: Andy Lutomirski <luto@kernel.org>
Date:   Wed Aug 10 02:29:17 2016 -0700

    x86/efi: Allocate a trampoline if needed in efi_free_boot_services()

So we could handle it in the same place by extending the area to the
whole low-1M unconditionally. This is 1st way of three I can think of.

The other two are:
2) Move efi_reserve_boot_services() down to be above init_mem_mapping().
until init_mem_mapping(), we stop reserving memory from low-1M with
memblock_reserve(). The change is like below:

diff --git a/arch/x86/kernel/setup.c b/arch/x86/kernel/setup.c

3) Do it in efi_reserve_boot_services() as you are doing in this patch.

I prefer the 1st and 2nd way.

And by the way, the original code of commit 5bc653b731821("x86/efi: Allocate
a trampoline if needed in efi_free_boot_services()") could be buggy. I
remember you ever pasted the boot log of system where you reproduced
issue and tested the tested patch, there are three separate pages from
low-1M reserved by boot services. If any of them falls into real mode
area, it will break the fix of commit 5bc653b731821.
