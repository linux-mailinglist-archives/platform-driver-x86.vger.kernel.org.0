This is not something which we have made mandatory for old code to
switch too. The idea is that you get one wmi_device per guid
under: /sys/bus/wmi/devices/

And then the old platform_drivers (which do typically use
"wmi:GUID" as modalias) are converted to wmi_drivers which
bind to a wmi_device and can make calls on that using e.g. :

wmidev_evaluate_method(wmi_dev, ...)

instead of:

wmi_evaluate_method(GUID, ...)

Grep for module_wmi_driver in drivers/platform/x86
for drivers which have been converted to use this.

I see that the asus code uses 3 GUIDs:

ASUS_WMI_MGMT_GUID
ASUS_NB_WMI_EVENT_GUID
EEEPC_WMI_EVENT_GUID

With the first one being shared and the modalias-es
for the asus-nb-wmi resp eeepc-wmi drivers actually
pointing to the 2 EVENT_GUIDs.

So you could change things to have the 2 drivers
bind to the 2 different event_guids, they can
then also have a notify callback as part of their
driver structure instead of having to call

wmi_install_notify_handler() / wmi_remove_notify_handler()

###

Actually, never mind, switching to the new way of doing things
will move all the sysfs attributes from
/sys/devices/platform/asus-nb-wmi/...
to some thing like:
/sys/devices/platform/PNP0C14:07/wmi_bus/wmi_bus-PNP0C14:07/D931B4CF-F54E-4D07-9420-42858CC6A234

So this would be a clear userspace API break :|

IOW we are stuck with using the old way of doing things
in asus-wmi.

Hans

If some problem arises due to manual control of fan then there is no way for ppd to determine if manual was enabled without actually looking.
