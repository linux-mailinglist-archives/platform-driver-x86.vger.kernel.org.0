Not necessarily fully off, but maybe when suspended ?

Right I understand still I think there should be a separate

drivers/platform/x86/acpi_pnp0c32_buttons.c 

driver for this IMHO. If it is only tested on your one model that
is fine (should be documented with a comment in the code though).

Then at least we have something to serve as a basis for if people
want to add support for this on more laptop models.

Does that sound reasonable ?

Ack.

Right, the idea is to document that the hw/fw/driver may only
support some fixed values and that written values will be
rounded to one of the supported fixed values. There is no need
to document what those fixed values are.  The idea is that
userspace consumers will read back the value to see what
they actually got.
