I think that using wmi_evaluate_method() is deprecated and we should try t=
o minimize its usage whenever possible. As for the handling of the WMI GUI=
Ds, i believe that
just using the first matching WMI device is not a stable solution. We simp=
ly do not know if Lenovo considers both WMI GUIDs singletons or not. This =
means they could
for example decide to have multiple independent data sources for tablet mo=
de events. The chances for this are indeed small, but it will still create=
 a problem for users
using such machines. By having two drivers and maybe a global notifier cal=
l chain, we would enable the driver to handle such "unlikely situations" c=
orrectly.

This would also allow the driver to work on machines missing the WMI event=
 GUID. In such a case, userspace could then just poll the data WMI GUID fo=
r input, but
this is just an idea.

The allowlist is dealing with drivers not jet converted to the WMI bus mod=
el. The allowlist should ideally disappear once the conversion has been
completed, something which would become difficult if WMI drivers would con=
tinue to rely on the older GUID singleton behavior which is not compliant
with the ACPI WMI spec AFAIK. If we know that our WMI GUID is a singleton =
(which we do not), then we should handle this inside our driver, not insid=
e
the WMI probing code.
