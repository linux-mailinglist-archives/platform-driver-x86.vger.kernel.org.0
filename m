I ended up just testing the patch for myself (after adding my model number to
the arrays), and it does improve the GPU performance further for me, instead
of the GPU dropping to 75W after 2-4 minutes it is now able to maintain at least
100W even after 10 minutes (tested with Quake 2 RTX). So, it seems like the timer
thing also applies to my Omen 16-n0000 (8A42). That performance also roughly
matches up with how notebookcheck.net says my Omen performs in their review
(103W performance, 72W balanced), so it'd be great if you can also include my
model in your patch.

I just ran more tests with the CPU performance, and it seems that I might have
misremembered how bad the fan curve was, since I have been limiting the CPU
frequency to 4GHz instead of letting the CPU do its thing by itself (max boost is
4.7GHz), if I go back to the latter then with a heavily multithreaded workload
(like compiling the kernel) the fans ramp up high within a few seconds of the
CPU reaching 100C on its hottest core, and the CPU seems to maintain that
temperature (or the sensors just don't report values above 100C, not sure). That
seems worrying given that the supposed max operating temperature for the CPU
(Ryzen 7 6800H) is 95C, but then again that probably won't be the case when gaming,
which is the main use case for these laptops anyway.
