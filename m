v1->v2:
- Attempt to resolve all review comments from v1 as written here:
https://lore.kernel.org/platform-driver-x86/53c5075b-1967-45d0-937f-463912dd966d@gmx.de/T/#mbcbd8d5d9bc4496bac5486636c7d3b32bc3e5cd0

v2->v3:
- Tweak to battery attribute to closer match pattern in dell-wmi-ddv
- implement platform_profile_remove() change from
  9b3bb37b44a317626464e79da8b39989b421963f
- Small tweak to Documentation page

v3->v4:
- Remove custom tracepoint (can trace via existing mechanisms)
- Remove module parameters
- Move sysfs attributes from device to firmware-attributes
- Refactor "allow_recording" to "camera_lens_cover" plus other small
  renames in aim to have more standardized naming that are cross-vendor
- Attempt to improve locking mechanisms
- Tweak logic for setting and getting led brightness
- More fixes for aiming to use devres/devm pattern
- Change battery charge end threshold to use 1 to 100 instead of 0 to 99
- Add swtich input event for camera_lens_cover remove all others (they will
  be generated as ACPI netlink events instead)
- Various other small tweaks and features as requested from feedback

v4-v5:
- Prefix all locally defined symbols with "GB_" as a namespace
- Remove extra unused out_buf from galaxybook_acpi_method
- Tighten up logic flow for setting and unsetting global pointer (now it
  is done directly in association with the i8042 filter init and exit)
- Rename "camera_lens_cover" to "block_recording"
- Change input device to only apply for "Camera Lens Cover", remove sparse
  keymap and set capabilities manually as part of block_recording init,
  then notify using input_report_switch when setting block_recording
- Correct firmware-attributes enumeration implementation (adding all
  attributes) and remove erroneous ABI fw attrs docs update
- Few small tweaks to how locks are used
- Use device_unregister instead of device_destroy for firmware attributes
  device
- Tighten up and clean up performance mode to profile mapping logic; now
  the mapping is largely "fixed" apart from "Ultra" that will map to
  performance while also re-mapping "Performance" to balanced-performance
- Tighten up error handling so probe will fail in more cases where it
  should fail
- Replace platform_profile_register with devm_platform_profile_register

v5->v6:
- A few small clean-up/fixes as requested from feedback
- Revamp performance mode profile mapping so it is more static and relies
  more on the facilities already built in to platform_profile, including:
  - setting and using bits on profile handler choices to drive most of the
    behavior instead of having totally separate logic
  - get_performance_mode_profile() is now a mostly static mapping that
    drives both setting initial profile choices and retrieving the right
    profile for a given performance_mode during runtime
  - during init most of the mappings are hard-coded and the only things
    that are changed are the exception cases (override legacy values and
    downgrade of performance when Ultra mode is present)
  - new function galaxybook_performance_mode_init() now handles initial
    startup performance mode in a much more simple and straight-forward way

v6->v7:
- Rebase to latest for-next and implement updates to firmware-attributes,
  platform_profile, and i8042 filter (including removal of global pointer).

v7->v8:
- Simplification and logic correction to platform_profile mapping and
  probe implementation, including renaming the internal performance modes
  to more closely match the internal names used by Samsung in Windows and
  align the logic in this driver to how it works with their Windows
  services.

v8->v9:
- Refactored "optional feature" init logic to return EOPNOTSUPP instead of
  0 and then centralized handling of various flags in the probe function
- Re-sorted so get/show functions are always defined before set/store
- Removed manually deleting fw_attrs (kset_unregister takes care of this)
- Removed some unnecessary variable initializations
- Removed manually creating charge_control_end_threshold sysfs attribute
  and implemented new power supply extension framework instead
- Removed gb_pfmode() macro and instead use a local pointer in
  galaxybook_platform_profile_probe()

v9->v10:
- Change "not supported" error code to use a locally defined symbol
  GB_NOT_SUPPORTED instead of directly returning EOPNOTSUPP as it is more
  self-documenting and avoids checkpatch warnings which would otherwise be
  present when returning positive error codes
- Also brought up Thomas's and Armin's Reviewed-by tag so they do not get
  lost in the shuffle :)

+==========================
+Samsung Galaxy Book Driver
+==========================
+
+Joshua Grisham <josh@joshuagrisham.com>
+
+This is a Linux x86 platform driver for Samsung Galaxy Book series notebook
+devices which utilizes Samsung's ``SCAI`` ACPI device in order to control
+extra features and receive various notifications.
+
+Supported devices
+=================
+
+Any device with one of the supported ACPI device IDs should be supported. This
+covers most of the "Samsung Galaxy Book" series notebooks that are currently
+available as of this writing, and could include other Samsung notebook devices
+as well.
+
+Status
+======
+
+The following features are currently supported:
+
+- :ref:`Keyboard backlight <keyboard-backlight>` control
+- :ref:`Performance mode <performance-mode>` control implemented using the
+  platform profile interface
+- :ref:`Battery charge control end threshold
+  <battery-charge-control-end-threshold>` (stop charging battery at given
+  percentage value) implemented as a battery hook
+- :ref:`Firmware Attributes <firmware-attributes>` to allow control of various
+  device settings
+- :ref:`Handling of Fn hotkeys <keyboard-hotkey-actions>` for various actions
+- :ref:`Handling of ACPI notifications and hotkeys
+  <acpi-notifications-and-hotkey-actions>`
+
+Because different models of these devices can vary in their features, there is
+logic built within the driver which attempts to test each implemented feature
+for a valid response before enabling its support (registering additional devices
+or extensions, adding sysfs attributes, etc). Therefore, it can be important to
+note that not all features may be supported for your particular device.
+
+The following features might be possible to implement but will require
+additional investigation and are therefore not supported at this time:
+
+- "Dolby Atmos" mode for the speakers
+- "Outdoor Mode" for increasing screen brightness on models with ``SAM0427``
+- "Silent Mode" on models with ``SAM0427``
+
+.. _keyboard-backlight:
+
+Keyboard backlight
+==================
+
+A new LED class named ``samsung-galaxybook::kbd_backlight`` is created which
+will then expose the device using the standard sysfs-based LED interface at
+``/sys/class/leds/samsung-galaxybook::kbd_backlight``. Brightness can be
+controlled by writing the desired value to the ``brightness`` sysfs attribute or
+with any other desired userspace utility.
+
+.. note::
+  Most of these devices have an ambient light sensor which also turns
+  off the keyboard backlight under well-lit conditions. This behavior does not
+  seem possible to control at this time, but can be good to be aware of.
+
+.. _performance-mode:
+
+Performance mode
+================
+
+This driver implements the
+Documentation/userspace-api/sysfs-platform_profile.rst interface for working
+with the "performance mode" function of the Samsung ACPI device.
+
+Mapping of each Samsung "performance mode" to its respective platform profile is
+performed dynamically by the driver, as not all models support all of the same
+performance modes. Your device might have one or more of the following mappings:
+
+- "Silent" maps to ``low-power``
+- "Quiet" maps to ``quiet``
+- "Optimized" maps to ``balanced``
+- "High performance" maps to ``performance``
+
+The result of the mapping can be printed in the kernel log when the module is
+loaded. Supported profiles can also be retrieved from
+``/sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile_choices``, while
+``/sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile`` can be used to read or write the
+currently selected profile.
+
+The ``balanced`` platform profile will be set during module load if no profile
+has been previously set.
+
+.. _battery-charge-control-end-threshold:
+
+Battery charge control end threshold
+====================================
+
+This platform driver will add the ability to set the battery's charge control
+end threshold, but does not have the ability to set a start threshold.
+
+This feature is typically called "Battery Saver" by the various Samsung
+applications in Windows, but in Linux we have implemented the standardized
+"charge control threshold" sysfs interface on the battery device to allow for
+controlling this functionality from the userspace.
+
+The sysfs attribute
+``/sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/charge_control_end_threshold`` can be used to
+read or set the desired charge end threshold.
+
+If you wish to maintain interoperability with the Samsung Settings application
+in Windows, then you should set the value to 100 to represent "off", or enable
+the feature using only one of the following values: 50, 60, 70, 80, or 90.
+Otherwise, the driver will accept any value between 1 and 100 as the percentage
+that you wish the battery to stop charging at.
+
+.. note::
+  Some devices have been observed as automatically "turning off" the charge
+  control end threshold if an input value of less than 30 is given.
+
+.. _firmware-attributes:
+
+Firmware Attributes
+===================
+
+The following enumeration-typed firmware attributes are set up by this driver
+and should be accessible under
+``/sys/class/firmware-attributes/samsung-galaxybook/attributes/`` if your device
+supports them:
+
+- ``power_on_lid_open`` (device should power on when the lid is opened)
+- ``usb_charging``  (USB ports can deliver power to connected devices even when
+  the device is powered off or in a low sleep state)
+- ``block_recording`` (blocks access to camera and microphone)
+
+All of these attributes are simple boolean-like enumeration values which use 0
+to represent "off" and 1 to represent "on". Use the ``current_value`` attribute
+to get or change the setting on the device.
+
+Note that when ``block_recording`` is updated, the input device "Samsung Galaxy
+Book Lens Cover" will receive a ``SW_CAMERA_LENS_COVER`` switch event which
+reflects the current state.
+
+.. _keyboard-hotkey-actions:
+
+Keyboard hotkey actions (i8042 filter)
+======================================
+
+The i8042 filter will swallow the keyboard events for the Fn+F9 hotkey (Multi-
+level keyboard backlight toggle) and Fn+F10 hotkey (Block recording toggle)
+and instead execute their actions within the driver itself.
+
+Fn+F9 will cycle through the brightness levels of the keyboard backlight. A
+notification will be sent using ``led_classdev_notify_brightness_hw_changed``
+so that the userspace can be aware of the change. This mimics the behavior of
+other existing devices where the brightness level is cycled internally by the
+embedded controller and then reported via a notification.
+
+Fn+F10 will toggle the value of the "block recording" setting, which blocks
+or allows usage of the built-in camera and microphone (and generates the same
+Lens Cover switch event mentioned above).
+
+.. _acpi-notifications-and-hotkey-actions:
+
+ACPI notifications and hotkey actions
+=====================================
+
+ACPI notifications will generate ACPI netlink events under the device class
+``samsung-galaxybook`` and bus ID matching the Samsung ACPI device ID found on
+your device. The events can be received using userspace tools such as
+``acpi_listen`` and ``acpid``.
+
+The Fn+F11 Performance mode hotkey will be handled by the driver; each keypress
+will cycle to the next available platform profile.
