I talked with Mika and now I'm working on a way to read BIOSWE, BIOSLE
and FLOCKDN values from the chip through pci (not using intel-spi
driver), you will see it in near future. Unfortunately this is only to
see if the vendor did the homework and set the flags correctly before
the spi leaves the factory. This is still useful to see if the write
protection mechanism it's in place.
We are still interested in a way to get the BIOS, for this the first
way you think of is reading it using the spi but after this (also from
[1] )

It seems that is not an option to use it.

This is not my patch.

The proposal I sent makes the driver work only with read ops, but that
was not the issue with this driver. The issue was something related to
a status register and this was fixed. So if there is no issue with
write/erase ops, the bug was fixed and there is no intention to remove
the tag. What kind of proposal are we talking about?
