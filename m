How to deal with this is actually one of my remaining questions too.

I've not looked at the new code closely yet, but if I understand
things correctly, the now code basically only allows to set 1
custom profile and setting that profile overrides the last
profile set through /sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile.

And any write to /sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile will
overwrite / replace the last custom set profile (if any) with
the one matching the requested platform-profile.

So basically users of custom fan profiles are expected to
disable power-profiles-daemon or at least to refrain from
making any platform_profile changes.

And if power-profile-daemon is actually active and
makes a change then any custom settings will be thrown away,
IOW p-p-d will always win. So I believe that it no longer needs
to check for custom profiles, since any time it requests a
standard profile that will overwrite any custom profile
which may be present.

Luke, do I have that right ?

> Also, was this patch accepted in the pdx86 tree?

No, I still need to find/make some time to review it and
I still have the same question as you :)

Hans
