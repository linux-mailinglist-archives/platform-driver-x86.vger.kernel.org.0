My experience confirms your consideration. The ThinkPad battery circuit
can handle exactly one battery at a time i.e.
- Charging, AC connected
- Forced discharging,  AC connected
- Discharging, AC disconnected
The other battery is always idle during this time.

Please wait until i'm finished with testing your queued v2. I am getting
errors here and would first like to rule out homemade problems with my
kernel build and/or base version.
