Right, I'm not saying this scheme is bad per se I just wanted to make
sure that this was brought up and discussed.

Note you will likely need some form of IPC, say dbus to your escrow process
anyways to ask it to unlock. So you could just change the "unlock" request
to a "set Camera=Enabled" request and have the process which has access
to the authentication token make the changes itself.

Thanks that is good to know and does address most of my concerns. What I was
wondering about is if we can enforce this in the kernel even for --privileged
containers.  I guess another question would be if we can do that, should we?
