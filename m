This talk about a top aggregation mask and about mlxreg-hotplug instantiating
other devices sounds like this should use MFD (which I think you already do?)
in combination with an irqchip at the MFD driver level which de-multiplexes
the interrupt in per instantiated device interrupts and the per-instantiated-device
drivers then use the child interrupts of this irqchip.  This is how this is normally
done.

Also if you clear the top aggregation mask *before* requesting the IRQ then the
(temporarily) disabling of the IRQ should not be necessary.

For now though, lets just go with a simple revert, including restoring the
disable_irq() call, so that I can queue up this revert as a fix for 5.13.

Regards,

Hans
