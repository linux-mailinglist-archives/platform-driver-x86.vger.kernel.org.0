I haven't been able to figure out so yet -- there's a 'device_list.json'
file (IIRC) defined somewhere in the Omen Control Center app which I came
across, but no simple way of universally checking if this behavior is
active :[

I think I remember that I've seen another model ID near mine being defined,
so I think I *could* add it directly to both lists though, so that's
that.

I think you've answered it yourself with your other mail ;]

I totally agree with you -- I just wanted to make sure that my patch was
conform enough with the rest of the codebae before making further progress :]

I've made some reverse engineering on the Omen Control Center app through a
Windows VM, and I came across a few WMI calls in a class (IIRC `HpaClient`, or
something similar to that name) that do reads to this fan curve.

I haven't yet found the parts that do writes unfortunately, that also
needs to be browsed through. :[

The ACPI table that handles those WMI "methods" is the `SSDT` one --
I've disassembled it with `iasl`, which really helped figuring out the
expected data structures.

There's also a post on Reddit which talks about this feature; since this
was posted 2 years ago, I'd say that at least *some* models support
this -- but maybe I'm just misinterpreting it?

Glad to hear that it helps! Your model will be part of both lists next time I
send my updated patches for a "refreshed" review :]

This is definitely problematic yet also what I kind of experience, even
though we both have a completely different combination of CPUs and GPUs
-- at least we can say that the "draft" patches work regardless of the
backed hardware, which is good to hear :]

Thanks for testing out my patch -- as I've said to Ilpo, I won't be able to do
much progress for a few weeks BUT I'm still on it as soon as I'm available
again!
