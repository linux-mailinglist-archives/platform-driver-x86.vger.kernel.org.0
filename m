The OLPC XO-1.75 Embedded Controller is a SPI master that uses extra
signals for handshaking. It needs to know when is the slave (Linux)
side's TX FIFO ready for transfer (the ready-gpio signal on the SPI
controller node) and when does it wish to respond with a command (the
cmd-gpio property).

+OLPC XO-1.75 Embedded Controller
+
+Required properties:
+- compatible: Should be "olpc,xo1.75-ec".
+- cmd-gpios: gpio specifier of the CMD pin
+
+The embedded controller requires the SPI controller driver to signal rea=
diness
+to receive a transfer (that is, when TX FIFO contains the response data)=
 by
+strobing the ACK pin with the ready signal. See the "ready-gpios" proper=
ty of the
+SSP binding as documented in:
+<Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-pxa2xx.txt>.
+
+Example:
+	&ssp3 {
+		spi-slave;
+		ready-gpios =3D <&gpio 125 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
+
+		slave {
+			compatible =3D "olpc,xo1.75-ec";
+			spi-cpha;
+			cmd-gpios =3D <&gpio 155 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
+		};
