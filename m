No worries, I think you are doing great so far.

Thank you for the detailed analysis and for all the work you are putting
into this.

I'll try to write a short reply to each feature separately,
I think we need to balance the worth of a feature to end users vs the amount
of code to write + maintain here. E.g. adding support for non working
hw buttons is generally considered worth the effort. Adding support for
changing the boot-order not so much.

Note there is a generic interface for changing BIOS options from
within Linux, so if you can change all (or almost all) BIOS options,
you could consider implementing support for:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-firmware-attributes

That has been implemented for Lenovo Think* and for some Dell
models, but by the vendors themselves and the used WMI APIs are
actually guaranteed to work on multiple models / generations hardware
making it worth the effort. Also this is something which their
customers want for managed rollout of these devices in big
companies.

IMHO for these Toshiba laptops I still think it is a lot of work
for something which won't see much use.

It would be good though to:
1. Write some generic documentation from an end user pov for toshiba_acpi as:
Documentation/admin-guide/laptops/toshiba_acpi.rst
see:
Documentation/admin-guide/laptops/thinkpad-acpi.rst
as an example

2. Extend the doc from 1. with toshiba_acpi firmware API documentation,
including your findings on protocol bits which we won't directly
implement/use so that this is at least written down in case it is
needed later.

For 2. you can actually just copy and paste a lot of this email,
I believe that having the info in this email in a
Documentation/admin-guide/laptops/toshiba_acpi.rst file
will make it a lot easier to find in the future then only having
it in the mailinglist archives.

Ok, this is interesting there actually is a specification from
Microsoft for this:
http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/c/5/9c5b2167-8017-4bae-9fde-d599bac8184a/dirapplaunch.docx

And there was a previous attempt to add support for the PNP0C32 devices:
https://marc.info/?l=linux-acpi&m=120550727131007
https://lkml.org/lkml/2010/5/28/327

And this even made it into drivers/staging for a while, if you do:
git revert 0be013e3dc2ee79ffab8a438bbb4e216837e3d52
you will get a: drivers/staging/quickstart/quickstart.c file.

Note this is not great code:

1. If you do:
  ls /sys/bus/platform/devices
  You should already see a couple of PNP0C32 platform devices there and the
  driver should simply bind to those rather then creating its own platform device
2. As mentioned this really should use the standard /dev/input/event interface
  for event reporting and allow userspace to change the scancode to EV_KEY*
  mapping. You can do this e.g. by using a sparse_keymap for the scancode to
  EV_KEY* mapping which will give you this for free.

I believe that sending the magic command to make these keys generate events
should be part of toshiba_acpi, combined with a generic PNP0C32 driver
for actually reporting the key-presses.

This looks good I'll go and merge it into my for-next git branch
sometime this week (I usually merge patches in batches).

Hmm, this is interesting if you look at:

Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-power

You will see there already is a standard API for this in the form of
adding a "charge_control_end_threshold" attribute to the standard
ACPI /sys/class/power_supply/BAT*/ sysfs interface. See e.g.
drivers/platform/x86/thinkpad_acpi.c

For an example of how to add sysfs attributes to a battery
which is managed by the standard drivers/acpi/battery.c driver.

I think you can use this standard attribute enabling eco charging
for any writes with a value <= 90 and disabling it for values
> 90 (90 being halfway between 80 and 100).

While always showing 80 or 100 on read.

You should then also write a patch for:

Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-power

Adding something like this to the "charge_control_end_threshold"
section:

"not all hardware is capable of setting this to an arbitrary
percentage. Drivers will round written values to the nearest
supported value. Reading back the value will show the actual
threshold set by the driver."

(feel free to copy verbatim, but maybe you can do better)

I think this is another case of some Toshiba devices needing the
acpi_video backlight level save/restore behavior over suspend/resume
while leaving the actual backlight control to intel_backlight.

Quoting from: drivers/acpi/acpi_video.c :

         * Some machines have a broken acpi-video interface for brightness
         * control, but still need an acpi_video_device_lcd_set_level() call
         * on resume to turn the backlight power on.  We Enable backlight
         * control on these systems, but do not register a backlight sysfs
         * as brightness control does not work.
         */
        {
         /* https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21012 */
         .callback = video_disable_backlight_sysfs_if,
         .ident = "Toshiba Portege R700",

                DMI_MATCH(DMI_SYS_VENDOR, "TOSHIBA"),
                DMI_MATCH(DMI_PRODUCT_NAME, "PORTEGE R700"),
                },
        },

Toshiba Satellite R830:  https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21012

You can see if the same option fixes things for you by adding:
"video.disable_backlight_sysfs_if=1" to your kernel commandline while
removing all other options. If this works, please submit a patch to
add your model to the list in drivers/acpi/acpi_video.c, or provide
dmidecode output, then I can do it for you.

As discussed above I don't really think we should bother; and IMHO
certainly not something worth spending time on before the other issues
are wrapped up.

> 7.2 Setting USB memory emulation

> #define SCI_BOOT_FLOPPY_EMULATION 0x511
> #define SCI_BOOT_FLOPPY_EMULATION_FDD 0x1
> #define SCI_BOOT_FLOPPY_EMULATION_HDD 0x0
> 
> To set: {SCI_SET, SCI_BOOT_FLOPPY_EMULATION, value, 0, 0, 0}
> Getting/existence query: {SCI_GET, SCI_BOOT_FLOPPY_EMULATION, 0, 0, 0, 0}
> 
> 7.3 Display during boot
> -----------------------
> This controls if BIOS/GRUB/etc is shown on just the internal monitor or
> if the montior is automatically selected.
> 
> Note: When changing this in Windows it tells me a restart is required.
