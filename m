Artem,
I feel your pain. Believe me, I have got into the similar situation(s) myse=
lf
being actually a kernel developer! I'm often being frustrated, but that's h=
ow
it works in Linux and in OSS in general. The root cause here is the product=
ion
model used by world of Windows and world of Linux (and besides the downsides
like above I prefer the latter). For Windows the drivers are made for *THE
product* while in *nix world the drivers try to cover as many products as t=
hey
can with regard to the similarities and compatibility of the corresponding =
IPs.
That's why people often see "oh, hey, it works in Windows!" Yes, it works, =
but
if and only if you are using the very same *THE product*. Step right or left
will be a suicidal in that model. The Windows model is very fragile because=
 of
this and requires 10x times more resources to develop the code. OSS communi=
ty
simply does not have such resources to fulfill a job and due to economical
reasons even Micro$oft also found advantages in the OSS model (but not with=
 the
drivers, unfortunately). The best help for you and for the rest is to be on=
 the
constructive side. You see, you even may yourself to develop a solution and
become (a well paid) kernel developer. Or just for fun (look at the example=
 of
Intel IPU3 CIO2 camera glue layer (to support Windows only platforms) which=
 is
done solely by one guy who declared that he even didn't know C programming
language before!

So, please, do not blame people here, it's rather the problem of the model.
