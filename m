That will probably work, but only if there is only 1 variable sized
struct which you want to embed.

Also note that in the current use-case the struct is embedded in
a sub-struct of the main driver_data struct, so then not only
would this need to be the last member of the sub-struct, but
the sub-struct itself would need to be the last member of
the main driver_data struct.

Variable sized structs can be nice sometimes, but in cases where
we may want to embed them they are not always ideal.

Right, so there is precedent for this variant too.

I see that the gpio and reset lookups indeed both use dev_id and con_id
I will change the LED lookups to use this to for version 5 of this
patch-set.
