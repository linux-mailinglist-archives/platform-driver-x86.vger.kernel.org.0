But this is exactly how it works. There is no risk of data loss.



The EC resets the force_discharge flag at the end of the discharge and
the ThinkPad is seamlessly switched back to AC power. Just magical. No
power interruptions.



Maybe now you understand why Linux users want this so badly?

Fine. There you have it, the patch is the working kernel solution for
your end goal and even more.



'tlp recalibrate' already does the user space job

handling



/sys/class/power_supply/BATx/force_discharge =3D 1 (TLP 1.4)



and includes setting



/sys/class/power_supply/AC/charge_control_end_threshold =3D 100



for a full recharge.



Mark may initiate GUI support if he so desires.
