Afaik most of the initial uniwill module in tuxedo-drivers was written by 
Christoffer, he is currently on holiday, but I will ask him when he is back. I 
also did later added to it later.

Since this driver is a complete rewrite I'm not sure if a Co-developed by for 
Christoffer and me is appropriate, but we would ofc be happy about it. Maybe for 
finding out the EC register meanings that you probably at least partially copied 
over from tuxedo-drivers?

Or do you see another label more fitting?

Best regards,

Werner
