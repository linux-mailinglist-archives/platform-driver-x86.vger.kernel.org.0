Changes in v4:
 - Fix file naming mistake in MAINTAINERS
 - Re-order patches so this one is now second in series
Changes in v3:
 - implement file naming as suggested by Andy Shevchenko
 - Removed documentation as not required
 - Added date to Makefile for improved clarity on split
 - Cosmetic clean ups.
Changes in v2:
 - Rebased to Linus's latest as requested
 - Updated documentation reference
 - Updated MAINTAINER file
 - Removed X86_PLATFORM_DRIVERS_LENOVO as I was worried about
   maintaining backwards compatibility for the distros.
 - Removed 2nd patch in series splitting out hkeys. That will be for
   the future

-
-	  Optionally, the driver will also allow software control (the
-	  ALSA mixer will be made read-write).  Please refer to the driver

-config THINKPAD_ACPI_UNSAFE_LEDS
-	bool "Allow control of important LEDs (unsafe)"
-	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
-	help
-	  Overriding LED state on ThinkPads can mask important
-	  firmware alerts (like critical battery condition), or misled
-	  the user into damaging the hardware (undocking or ejecting
-	  the bay while buses are still active), etc.
-
-	  LED control on the ThinkPad is write-only (with very few
-	  exceptions on very ancient models), which makes it
-	  impossible to know beforehand if important information will
-	  be lost when one changes LED state.
-
-	  Users that know what they are doing can enable this option
-	  and the driver will allow control of every LED, including
-	  the ones on the dock stations.
-
-	  Never enable this option on a distribution kernel.
-

-	  use, and need to control the important firmware LEDs.

-	default y
-	help
-	  Allows the thinkpad_acpi driver to provide an interface to control
-	  the various video output ports.
-
-	  This feature often won't work well, depending on ThinkPad model,
-	  display state, video output devices in use, whether there is a X
-	  server running, phase of the moon, and the current mood of
-	  Schroedinger's cat.  If you can use X.org's RandR to control
-	  your ThinkPad's video output ports instead of this feature,
-	  don't think twice: do it and say N here to save memory and avoid
-	  bad interactions with X.org.
-
-	  NOTE: access to this feature is limited to processes with the
-	  CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability, to avoid local DoS issues in platforms
-	  where it interacts badly with X.org.
-
-	  If you are not sure, say Y here but do try to check if you could

-config THINKPAD_ACPI_HOTKEY_POLL
-	bool "Support NVRAM polling for hot keys"
-	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
-	default y
-	help
-	  Some thinkpad models benefit from NVRAM polling to detect a few of
-	  the hot key press events.  If you know your ThinkPad model does not
-	  need to do NVRAM polling to support any of the hot keys you use,
-	  unselecting this option will save about 1kB of memory.
-
-	  ThinkPads T40 and newer, R52 and newer, and X31 and newer are
-	  unlikely to need NVRAM polling in their latest BIOS versions.
-
-	  NVRAM polling can detect at most the following keys: ThinkPad/Access
-	  IBM, Zoom, Switch Display (fn+F7), ThinkLight, Volume up/down/mute,
-	  Brightness up/down, Display Expand (fn+F8), Hibernate (fn+F12).
-
