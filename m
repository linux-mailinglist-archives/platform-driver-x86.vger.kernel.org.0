Sorry for the slow reply on this one.

I checked with the FW team and they confirmed on the x380 Yoga that the implementation is unique and not using the ECRD/WCWR ACPI methods. They didn't say why...but it's not expected to be something done again.

I had missed the question about fan control so didn't ask about that. Is there a reason you need to change the fans? It's generally not recommended as it can violate temperature specs and leads to all sorts of issues.

I don't know if the fact this is a one off makes this a better candidate as a quirk? To reduce the risk of breaking something on other platforms? But the code changes looked sensible to me.

I'll aim to do some builds with it in and test it on a few platforms - but I'm travelling next week so this week (and almost certainly the week after) are a bit hectic.

Thanks
Mark
