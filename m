Hi Mark,

Thank you for this new version.

With the change from a more generic API to this new one more targeted towards DPTF
I would drop this part.

I think the description here is a bit too specific, this may cause userspace
to have expectations which are not necessary true. I would describe this as
just:

		quiet:			Emphasises quieter operation

The part about custom profiles below may be dropped. That was intended for use
with e.g. GPUs but since this now strictly is a system-level profile API, the
part below can be dropped now.
