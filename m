Denis,

I'm on Gentoo, and already have the kernel sources unpacked and ready to go
(5.13.13-gentoo).  I did the following:

# rmmod nct6775
# cd /usrc/src/linux
# patch -i ~/nct6775_wmi_v3.patch -p1
# make modules -j12
# mv
/lib/modules/5.13.13-gentoo-splig-3-sensors/kernel/drivers/hwmon/nct6775.ko
/lib/modules/5.13.13-gentoo-splig-3-sensors/kernel/drivers/hwmon/nct6775.ko=
.orig
# cp drivers/hwmon/nct6775.ko
/lib/modules/5.13.13-gentoo-splig-3-sensors/kernel/drivers/hwmon/nct6775.ko
# modprobe nct6775

"sensors" output remains the same:

I hope that's of some use.  The differing dmesg output suggests that the pa=
tch
is helping, but shouldn't there be a change (improvement) to the sensors
output?
