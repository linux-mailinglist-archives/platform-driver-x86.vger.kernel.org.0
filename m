Great, thank you for picking op Gergo's work on this!

Unfortunately the kernel process is not very newcomer friendly,
so chances are you will make make some mistakes / miss some steps
with your first submission.

Note that that (making some mistakes) is totally fine, the best
advice I can give you is don't be afraid to make mistakes :)

If something needs to be fixed before the patches can be merged
I or another reviewer will gently point that out and you can
prepare a new version addressing any remarks.

The only other advise I have is try to use "git send-email"
to send out the patches, some people copy and paste them
into a regular email client to send them and most email
clients then mangle the patch (change whitespace, wrap
lines, etc.).

Regards,

Hans
