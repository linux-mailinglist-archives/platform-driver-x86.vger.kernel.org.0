Hi Rafael,
since 6.13-rc1 is out, hopefully you can have a look over the next few days

We have deployed a variant of this patchset now on desktop builds as
well for over 2 months now, and we haven't had any regressions
reported. We have also been using it on handheld builds, where for the
last 2 or so weeks we transition to the sleep state and fire the dpms
as part of the systemd sleep target, and it makes a big difference in
how devices look when suspending and hibernating.

Essentially, as soon as the suspend animation plays, the screen and
rgb of the devices turn off instantly, and the power light of devices
that have it as part of the sleep call begins to flash. Then, after a
few seconds, the fan of the devices turns off. Before, they'd show a
stale framebuffer and have the RGB be on until almost the suspend
sequence is over.

This is also true for hibernation, where before the RGB lights of the
devices would stay on during the suspend sequence and the device would
show a stale frame buffer on the screen. Now the devices look like
they are suspended while initializing hibernation and then just turn
off

Maybe I need to shoot a video with it..

So I'd love to hear your thoughts. Can you expand on what you mean by
not backwards compatible?

I know that it is not backwards compatible in the way where if the
compositor/init system are not aware of it, the display on/off
notifications will not fire automatically when the displays turn off.
