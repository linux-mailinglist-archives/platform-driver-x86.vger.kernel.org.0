Hi Hans,

Two things:
* I have discovered that reading the fan RPM in toshiba_acpi is slow,
  around 50 ms. I didn't notice it at first, but after adding some more
  sensors I found (current and voltage for AC and battery) it started to
  make running "sensors" visibly slow.
  
  I don't know what proper fix to this would be. Feel free to revert the
  fan RPM for now if it is not acceptable for reading sensors to block for
  ~50 ms (as opposed to the 100s of micro-seconds that other sensors such
  as coretemp and acpitz take to read on that laptop).

* I never got any feedback from you on the cover letter of this patch
  series: https://www.spinics.net/lists/platform-driver-x86/msg34818.html

  In a reply to the one of the patches in the series you alluded to that
  you would write a reply to the cover letter as well. Instead you sent
  the response to patch 1/2 twice. We are already halfway through the merge
  window soon, so I would appreciate getting that feedback soon.

Best regards,
Arvid Norlander
