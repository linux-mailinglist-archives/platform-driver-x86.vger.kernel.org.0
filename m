Thinking some more about this I am having second doubts about
moving the LPS0 display power off call to before devices are suspended,
doing so would mean that the display might still be on when that call
is made and that call could disable power-resources which are necessary
for the display causing issues when the display driver's suspend method
runs.

So I think that we need something closer to Mario's POC from:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/superm1/linux.git/log/?h=superm1/dsm-screen-on-off

here where the call is made when the last display is turned off.

IOW have the drm modesetting core call this.

Maybe have something like a enabled_displays counter in the
drm-core which gets increased / decreased by helpers and
have the drm-core call platform_suspend_screen_off() /
platform_suspend_screen_on() when the counter goes from 1 -> 0
resp. 0 -> 1, ignoring the very first 0 -> 1 transition
which will be done when the first GPU with an enabled
output is found ?

The idea being that the first increase() call gets made when
a drm/kms driver probes a display and finds outputs which are
light up during probe() and then further increase / decrease
calls are made either when all displays go off; or maybe
per crtc when the crtc gets enabled / disabled.

Anyways how best to do this at display off time should be
discussed with the drm/kms community on the dri-devel list.

Regards,

Hans
