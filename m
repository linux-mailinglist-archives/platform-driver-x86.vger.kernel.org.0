No worries, thanks for the swift reply.

Correct:

% libinput list-devices | grep Intel
Device:           Intel Virtual Buttons
Device:           Intel Virtual Switches
Device:           Intel HID events
Device:           Intel HID 5 button array

Correct.

Correct.
N.B.: It still triggers wakeup when I flip or detach the keyboard.  In order to prevent that, I have to both unload intel-vbtn entirely *and* disable the XHC wake-up trigger, if I didn't miss anything.

Correct.

Thanks for taking the time for an explanation.  Sounds like *not* needing the VBDL call should be default, and that rather the devices that need it are quirky.  Although that doesn't mean that the X1 Tablet is fine, because the side effect of immediately resuming also seems rare; otherwise it'd have been spotted and reported earlier by others, I suppose.  And, apparently, calling VBDL makes the X1 Tablet misreport the tablet mode state.
Hm.  Perhaps introducing a special handling of the Inspiron 7352 would be the way to go then?

FWIW, I previously dumped a DSDT (for entirely unrelated reasons): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akobel/linux-thinkpad-x1-tablet/main/x1-tablet-gen2/DSDT/dsl/dsdt.dsl
Just in case it's useful in further investigation/comparison to the Dell...
