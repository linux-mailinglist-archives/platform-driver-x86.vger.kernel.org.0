So the build-bots have found 2 issues:

1. Some symbols which are not exported need to be marked static (I will fix this myself,
that is the easiest / fastest):

drivers/platform/x86/thinkpad_acpi.c:10081:5: warning: no previous prototype for 'dytc_profile_get' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/platform/x86/thinkpad_acpi.c:10095:5: warning: no previous prototype for 'dytc_cql_command' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/platform/x86/thinkpad_acpi.c:10133:5: warning: no previous prototype for 'dytc_profile_set' [-Wmissing-prototypes]

2. This is a bigger problem, this is the result of a random-config test-build and I'm
pretty sure that the issue is that acpi_platform was build as a module while
thinkpad_acpi was builtin and builtin code cannot rely on modules.

drivers/platform/x86/thinkpad_acpi.c:10186: undefined reference to `platform_profile_notify'
drivers/platform/x86/thinkpad_acpi.c:10226: undefined reference to `platform_profile_register'
drivers/platform/x86/thinkpad_acpi.c:10246: undefined reference to `platform_profile_remove'

There are 2 ways to solve this:

1. Change

#if IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_ACPI_PLATFORM_PROFILE)

to:

#if IS_REACHABLE(CONFIG_ACPI_PLATFORM_PROFILE)

Which will disable the platform-profile support in acpi_thinkpad in the above scenario.

or.

2. Drop the #if IS_ENABLED(...) and add a

        depends on ACPI_PLATFORM_PROFILE

To the THINKPAD_ACPI Kconfig symbol.


I personally think 2. would be slightly better as it ensures that platform-profile
support is always available when thinkpad_acpi is build, hopefully leading to less
confusing bug-reports about it sometimes not working.

If you can let me know what you want, then I can fix this locally too and get
the fix in place before the merge-window opens.

Regards,

Hans
