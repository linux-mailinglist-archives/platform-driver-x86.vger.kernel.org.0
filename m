Hi Armin,

Thanks for your input. While looking at new WMI drivers which I could 
use as a reference, I stumbled upon 
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/platform-driver-x86/patch/20221004214332.35934-1-soyer@irl.hu/ 
which was sent last week and implements a driver for the same WMI 
interface. So I guess there is not much left for me to implement here, 
I'll just follow that patch.

Regards,
Lorenz
