Which tree did you have in mind?  PM stuff tends to go through Rafael's
tree, normally, which is fine.

I would really like to avoid adding ® symbols throughout the docs.  I get
grief for non-ASCII symbols that actually have a need to be there; this
isn't one of those.

In majority of the cases this selection is the most optimal, so there is no need for placing external constraints from the Operating System.

I would say that this violates the 80-character limit by a character or
two...  The entire patch has this problem.

Currently these customers uses MSR 0x620, to place hard limits on the maximum and the minimum uncore frequency. They can now use Linux sysfs to place these limits and also have additional capability to place hard limits under power constraint scenario.

less jitter (singular)

This may not render as you would like; use an RST literal block here.

Thanks,
