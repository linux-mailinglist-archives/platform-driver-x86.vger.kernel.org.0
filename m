The fwnode API has worked with references for a long time, looks like from
the very beginning of it, as in patch
8a0662d9ed2968e1186208336a8e1fab3fdfea63 .

If you're expecting an fwnode family of function returning another node,
then that function has to have taken a reference to that node before
returning it. Otherwise there's no guarantee that node is still there when
it is returned.

It may be this is not documented for every function doing so. That should
probably be added.
