No worries, it looks like you've done a pretty good job at picking the
right people + lists. And even if you didn't with regressions like this
*the* most important thing is to get the word out quickly, so thank
you for doing that!

That sounds like it is the right way to do it, can you share your patch please ?

And in the case I end up using your patch as is, may I add a:

Signed-off-by: Abhijeet Viswa <abhijeetviswa@gmail.com>

To the patch when committing it?

Once again, this is the right way, so no worries and thank you for reporting this.
