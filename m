That is good, still unfortunate that it takes so long though.

Hmm, I'm not sure what is the best thing to do here, if we end up making
4 calls of each 50 ms here, then that is going to block the caller for
200 ms which I guess might be just acceptable if we do it only once
per x seconds, for some value of x...

I guess you could use power_supply_is_system_supplied() to skip
the AC readings when not charging, but that ends up calling _PSR
on the ACPI AC device, which might also be slow.

Yes that sounds like a good idea. I guess you could also add support
for them in the driver, but then maybe activated with some "extended_hwmon"
kernel-module option. Which then should default to off I guess?
