acpi_video_backlight_use_native() sounds good, I like I will change
this for v2. This also removes churn in all the other
acpi_video_get_backlight_type() callers.

Hmm, as part of the ractoring there also will be new apple_gmux
and nvidia_wmi_ec types. I'm not sure about adding seperate functions
for all of those vs get_type() != foo. I like get_type != foo because
it makes clear that there will also be another caller somewhere
where get_type == foo and that that one will rbe the one which
actually gets to register its backlight.

Ack.
