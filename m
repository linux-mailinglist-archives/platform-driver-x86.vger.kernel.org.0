Great, i will review this v3 patch tomorrow.

I think this is the way to go.

Can you share your DSDT and the patch you applied to it to fix the _FST method?

This event is already provided to userspace through the battery and ac ACPI drivers.
I suggest you ignore it in the sparse keymap.

I think it should be removed from the keymap entirely.

-EIO is fine for signaling basic IO errors, and -ENXIO can be used in scenarios where
a valid message as received but which contains an error code signaling failure.

I suggest that you replace ETOOSMALL with EPROTO or ENOMSG, since ETOOSMALL is meant
to be used by the NFSv3 code.

It is safe to assume that calling ACPI methods itself it thread-safe, but you might need
to provide locking when it comes to the internal state of the driver.

It depends on the hardware implementation:

Does the EC change the keyboard backlight automatically before sending the event?
=> swallow the event and use led_classdev_notify_brightness_hw_changed()

Does the EC leave the keyboard backlight alone and only sends the event?
=> Emit KEY_KBDILLUMDOWN/KEY_KBDILLUMUP so userspace can change the keyboard backlight if desired

Please send the input event through the input device with the sparse keymap.

Depends, that will happen if recording gets disabled?

AFAIK you can submit keyup and keydown presses on the sparse keymap.

For the keyboard backlight: see my question above.

For the recording hotkey: i think you can keep the special handling but you should still
send an appropriate input event to userspace so that for example any recording software
gets notified that camera and mic access is disabled.

In this cases you should always filter out the original i8042 key presses to avoid sending
duplicate input events to userspace.

Should be OK, the ACPI WMI driver does something similar.
