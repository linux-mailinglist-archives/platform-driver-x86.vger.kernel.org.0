Maybe we can do the same thing as the battery hook API and just pass a poi=
nter to
the power_supply_ext instance to the callbacks. They then can use containe=
r_of()
to access the drivers private data if the struct power_supply_ext is embed=
ded
inside the private data struct.

Sound like a plan, i suggest that extensions be prevented from registering=
 with
a power supply containing conflicting properties or containing extensions =
with
conflicting properties.

As a side note, maybe there is a way to make power_supply_update_groups() =
available
for other power supply drivers? Afaik the ACPI battery driver would benefi=
t from this too.
