Hi Hans, not to worry and appreciate that you take the time! I have
been in good and capable hands with several eager and helpful
reviewers who are helping to push me in the right direction :) I
acknowledge everything from your message but will respond to only
certain points below:

Now that I have had some time to get over jet lag and craziness from
the last few weeks, I think this has finally sunk in and I am with you
all on firmware-attributes :) I have decided to revert the naming a
bit on what I had most recently called "camera_lens_cover" to what
Samsung device users will be familiar with: "block_recording"; the
rest of the attributes within the enumeration type group will exist so
hopefully it will be pretty self-explanatory and also help to soothe
some of the "unexpected side effects" confusion. It will still report
SW_CAMERA_LENS_COVER to its own "Camera Lens Cover" input device, but
the firmware-attribute itself under samsung-galaxybook will be called
"block_recording".

What I have landed on here is to forward along / generate acpi netlink
events against the platform driver name (samsung-galaxybook) for these
events, so for now users should be able to use acpid or similar
userspace tools if they really want to act on this, but otherwise
nothing else is being done by the driver. Please let me know if this
sounds like an ok approach or not and I can adjust accordingly. Also,
of course, if there is a different direction in the future where a
more formalized "userspace interface" for this is established, this
can be changed!

Similar to above is where I landed for this one as well: what I have
done for now is forward along these notifications as acpi netlink
events on samsung-galaxybook, so users should be able to see and act
on them if they really want to, but otherwise they are completely
"new" / custom events that should not disturb anything (and as said
before, this can be changed later if/when any formalized userpace
interface is established for this kind of notification event).

Thanks again and hopefully I will try to post v5 of this patch soon!
