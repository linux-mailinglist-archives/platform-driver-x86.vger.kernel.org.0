The database will be posted on intel.com eventually. Although I don't
believe the URL is public yet.

In this case minimal as it would really be no different than the read.
The registers in the memory regions themselves are read-only with no
read side effects.

I chose to use the class driver as a central place to store code
common to all of the instances of the class. In this case we have
quirks that are specific to Tiger Lake and so I chose to store the
function to test for the device here.

Not sure. I am not that familiar with the interface. It was something
I copied from read_bmof which is what I based this code on based on an
earlier suggestion.

I'm assuming that is because memcpy_fromio is assumed to handle this case?

I'm not sure how that would work. Basically what we are doing here is
determining the size of the mapping based on the number of pages that
will be needed. So we wake the pfn of the start of the region,
subtract that from the pfn for the end of the region and multiply by
the size of a page.

I'm not sure what you mean? If the size of the region is zero it means
there is no data there. There are cases in future devices where we may
have controls for a telemetry function that is actually streaming the
data elsewhere. That will be the use case for the entry size of 0 and
in that case it doesn't make any sense to have a file as there is no
data to present in it.

I'll drop it since it is a redundant.

I will just convert it instead. I think there might have been a bug
here in an earlier version where it was testing for NULL instead.

I think I get what you are trying to say. This is redundant since we
used the devm_ioremap_resource it will already be freed when the
driver is detached, correct?

That is already included from a few different sources.

Is included through xarray.h.

That one I will move from the class.c file.

That is included as a part of io.h.

Yeah, from what I can tell the only one I didn't have was io.h and
part of that is because this was something I had moved to the header
file in order to commonize it since it was being used in the other
drivers.
