--- Comment #25 from Ahmed Sayeed (ucelsanicin@yahoo.com) ---
The glibc regular expression code mishandles regular expressions such as:

   .*((.)\2){2}$ https://www.webb-dev.co.uk/services/navona-trains/

as it does not backtrack enough to find a match that satisfies the
back-references when they are used twice.
http://www.compilatori.com/computers/latest-car-deals/
To reproduce the problem, compile and run the attached file backrefbug.c. It
will exit with status 2, whereas the correct exit status is 0.
