No worries. I'm happy that you have managed to make some time

I see that you already have done that, thank you.

Brightness control is part of the standard sysfs LED class API:

Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-led
Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-led-multicolor

So that is already documented and those files also specify
userspace interaction. 

So what needs to be documented is the existing practice
of using foo::kbd_backlight as sysfs LED class-device name for
keyboards with a single brightness / color setting. As well as
documenting the new API + naming for zoned RGB keyboards.

So basically add a new "Keyboard backlight control"
section to:

Documentation/leds/leds-class.rst

Under the "LED Device Naming" section with as contents e.g.:

"""
For backlit keyboards with a single brightness / color settings a
single (multicolor) LED device should be used to allow userspace
to change the backlight brightness (and if possible the color). 
This LED device must have a name ending in ':kbd_backlight'.

For RGB backlit keyboards with multiple control zones one multicolor
LED device should be used per zone. These LED devices' name
must follow the following form:

	"<devicename>:rgb:kbd_zoned_backlight-<zone_name>"

and <devicename> must be the same for zones of a single keyboard.

Where possible <zone_name> should be a value already used by other
zoned keyboards with a similar or identical zone layout, e.g.:

<devicename>:rgb:kbd_zoned_backlight-right
<devicename>:rgb:kbd_zoned_backlight-middle
<devicename>:rgb:kbd_zoned_backlight-left
<devicename>:rgb:kbd_zoned_backlight-corners
<devicename>:rgb:kbd_zoned_backlight-wasd

or:

<devicename>:rgb:kbd_zoned_backlight-main
<devicename>:rgb:kbd_zoned_backlight-cursor
<devicename>:rgb:kbd_zoned_backlight-numpad
<devicename>:rgb:kbd_zoned_backlight-corners
<devicename>:rgb:kbd_zoned_backlight-wasd

Note this is intended for keyboards with a limited number of zones,
keyboards with per key addressable backlighting must not use LED
class devices since the sysfs API is not suitable for rapidly change
multiple LEDs in one "commit" as is necessary to do animations /
special effects on such keyboards.
"""

Feel free to use the above example verbatim, although if you think
you can improve on this, then that would be great :)

Regards,

Hans
