Agreed on all, I guess I was giving the story summary :)
I've been using this method in testing and if the \n gets passed on then
you'll get an error returned - the BIOS doesn't like it.

I've no idea if this is Lenovo specific or not. I'll document it as a
Lenovo specific case unless there are objections.
