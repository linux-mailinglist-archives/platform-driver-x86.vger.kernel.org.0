asus_nb_wmi_init -> asus_wmi_register_driver -> asus_wmi_probe -> asus_wmi_=
add
-> asus_wmi_hwmon_init

Although the warning messages are printed by ACPI code, but this is a confl=
ict
between the native nct6775 driver and the Asus wmi driver, because Asus wmi
driver accesses the same piece of resources and provide similar
functionalities. And I'm familiar with neither of them.

In Linux, at least for now, I don't see a way to enable native nct6775 driv=
er
by default, and, this is true for all the native drivers that have resource
conflict with the firmware.

IMO, the rootcause is that Linux does not support override driver A (native
driver in this case) when driver B (driver that talks to firmware) is loade=
d,
so we have to disable driver A even if there is only 0.01% possibility that
driver B will be loaded when we know there might be a conflict.

what we can do is to write driver B to make this statement true
"ACPI: If an ACPI driver is available for this device, you should use it
instead of the native driver" and ignore this message.

Hmmm, what about following conditions
1. "acpi_enforce_resources=3D" is a global switch, there might be platforms=
 with
more than one conflict, or with another conflict rather than nct6775. we can
not validate all of them.
2. we may have new drivers that talk with firmware later, and we can not use
"acpi_enforce_resources=3Dlax" then.

But thanks for raising this up, I think this also rings a bell that the cur=
rent
message is kind of misleading.
It is true that ACPI covers a series of devices as described in the ACPI sp=
ec.
But at the same time, ACPI is an interface. Many drivers, including vendor
specific drivers, talks with firmware through the ACPI Interface. They depe=
nds
on ACPI, but they're actually not covered by the ACPI specification, nor by
kernel drivers/acpi code.

"ACPI: If an ACPI driver is available for this device, you should use it
instead of the native driver" makes people feel like it is an ACPI problem,=
 but
in many cases, it is not, I can only triage them.
