Ok, so I was just thinking that this does not sound right to me,
since I did try echo-ing values to the profile while having the
GNOME control-panel open and I was pretty sure that it did
then actually update. So I just checked again and it does.

The thinkpad_acpi driver does not call platform_profile_notify()
on a write. But it does when receiving an event from the EC
that the profile has changed, which I guess is also fired on
a write from userspace.

But that notify pm an event is only done if the profile
read from the EC on the event is different then the last written
value. So this should not work, yet somehow it does work...

I even added a printk to thinkpad_acpi.c and it is indeed
NOT calling platform_profile_notify() when I echo a new
value to /sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile.

Ah I just checked the p-p-d code and it is using GFileMonitor
rather then watching for POLLPRI  / G_IO_PRI. I guess that
GFileMonitor is using inotify or some such and that catches
writes by other userspace processes, as well as the POLLPRI
notifies it seems, interesting.

Note that inotify does not really work on sysfs files, since
they are not real files and their contents is generated by the
kernel on the fly when read , so it can change at any time.
But I guess it does catch writes by other processes so it works
in this case.

This does advocate for always doing the notify since normally
userspace processes who want to check for sysfs changes should
do so by doing a (e)poll checking for POLLPRI  / G_IO_PRI and
in that scenario p-p-d would currently not see changes done
through echo-ing a new value to /sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile.

So long story short, Luke I believe that your decision to call
platform_profile_notify() on every write is correct.

###

This does mean that we still need to do:

2. Once we have an answer to 1. we need to documented the
expected behavior in Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-platform_profile

Does anyone feel up to writing a patch for this ?

3. If we go for doing a notify on any change, then we need
to update the existing drivers to do this.

I guess I should add this to my to-do list.

Regards,

Hans
