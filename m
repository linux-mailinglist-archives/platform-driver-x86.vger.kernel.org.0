Yes, Lenovo is actually offering Fedora as an OS choice when
ordering ThinkPads directly from their website in many countries
including when ordering as a consumer.

And unlike other vendor's Linux preloads which often use a kernel
with downstream laptop specific changes these laptops are running
unmodified Fedora kernels, which themselves are almost pristine
upstream kernels.

Lenovo (Mark) has been really good the last couple of years in
making sure that their hw just works with mainline kernels without
any downstream vendor specific patches.

Using KEY_INFO / KEY_VENDOR works for me too. So maybe we should
just go with one of those 2 ?
