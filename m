Well, this argument makes sense for any switch.

But all other defined keys in this driver are "standard" keys which may
or may not be present on de-facto standard keyboard: capslock,
brightness keys, volume keys, wifi key, eject key, ...
Probably generic AT keyboard driver may also report more standard keys
than it has.

So I'm not sure if it makes sense to rewrite wmi driver to dynamically
allocate presence of also every key based on first press.

If some userspace software depends on capabilities of "standard" keys
and reacts differently then I guess it is broken...

But for switches this dynamic behavior as you described is needed.
