There are 3 parts to it:

a) PMC driver[1] used without STB enabled
b) PMC driver used with STB enabled (but on older platforms before to
Rembrandt - where Spilling to DRAM is *not supported*[3])
c) PMC driver used with STB enabled (with platforms starting Rembrandt
and later - where the spilling to DRAM is *supported* [4])

Since we would need helper checks across all 3 cases, it should be okay
to name it as amd_pmc_is_cpu_supported().

[1] which is meant for s2idle suspend/resume transitions
[2] STB (Smart Trace Buffer) which is a shared buffer across several IP
blocks within the SoC.
[3] handled in amd_pmc_stb_debugfs_fops
[4] handled in amd_pmc_stb_debugfs_fops_v2

Thank you, have sent a v4.

Thanks,
