Please use strscpy, strncpy has horrible syntax and using it is easy
to get wrong.

e.g. the above example is wrong if strlen(new_pwd) >= TLMI_PWD_MAXLEN
the resulting setting->password will not be 0 terminated (and you
seem to have swapped src and dst, but that is unrelated to strncpy
being a sucky function).

This also make me realize that the code has 2 max-pwd-lengths:

setting->maxlen
TLMI_PWD_MAXLEN

I think you should put a:

	if (WARN_ON(pwdcfg.max_length > TLMI_PWD_MAXLEN))
		pwdcfg.max_length = TLMI_PWD_MAXLEN;

in tlmi_analyze() so that we get a kernel-backtrace (and thus bugreports
if this condition ever becomes true.

And then use pwdcfg.max_length everywhere (e.g. also for the check in
current_password_store()).

Also the length checks in current_password_store() and new_password_store() 
should probably also check against settings->minlen ?

That works for me. Perhaps you can also do a (compile tested only) RFC
patch for the Dell code to do the same thing (replace the memset 0 with
the strscpy) to see if the Dell folks are ok with also doing things this
way ?

Regards,

Hans
