Compiled with all patches from comment #14, 1) and 2).

Here are the first results.

1. s2idle was without sysfs settings. System was woken by closing the lid.

2. s2idle was with sysfs settings (see log). Directly after sleep I (un)plu=
gged
the power, opened/closed the lid and pressed keys on the keyboard. System w=
as
finally fully woken by pressing the power button.

3. s2idle was with sysfs settings (see log). System was going to sleep while
the lid was closed. Lid was opened after about 18 seconds. System was fully
woken by pressing the power button.

I'll now do another test for at least 30 minutes. So we can see the power
consumption.

That workaround works very well! Thanks :-)

Didn't make any sysfs of procfs settings. Opening/closing the lid, pressing
keyboard keys and disconnecting AC power didn't wake the system. And the
"deepest state" log reported the full time being in that state, so it didn't
return from "deepest state" early.
I didn't have time to do a long time test with the ec_no_wakeup workaround.
Tested it for max. 90 seconds.
(workaround is not in the attached log)
