Basic headers like that are kinda what almost any file uses, but
acpi.h is not the one which guarantees their inclusion (you see, it's
a layering violation: acpi is not low level generic library).

Including cpufreq.h in your code will seem weird. That's why I marked
it as an issue.

Me too, but the problem with strreplace(..., '\0') is that it sounds
like a half-baked strsep() solution. First of all, it will go and
replace all \n to \0 while you stop anyway on the first one in the
following code.
