> Hi Hans,

> Very helpful, thanks. I'd completely failed to notice platform_profile_notify in the platform_profile.h :| I've now put that in throttle_thermal_policy_write() just after sysfs_notify().

That means that the notify will also happen when the setting is
changed through handler->profile_set() this is not necessarily
a bad thing since there could be multiple user-space
processes accessing the profile and then others will be
notified when one of the processes makes a change.

But ATM the other drivers which use platform_profile_notify()
only do this when the profile is changed from outside of
userspace. Specifically by a hotkey handled directly by the
embedded-controller, this in kernel turbo-key handling is
very similar to that.

So if you add the platform_profile_notify() to 
throttle_thermal_policy_write() then asus-wmi will behave
differently from the other existing implementations.

So I think we need to do a couple of things here:

1. Decided what notify behavior is the correct behavior.
Bastien, since power-profiles-daemon is the main consumer,
what behavior do you want / expect?  If we make the assumption
that there will only be 1 userspace process accessing the
profile settings (e.g. p-p-d) then the current behavior
of e.g. thinkpad_acpi to only do the notify (send POLLPRI)
when the profile is changed by a source outside userspace
seems to make sense. OTOH as I mentioned above if we
assume there might be multiple userspace processes touching
the profile (it could even be an echo from a shell) then
it makes more sense to do the notify on all changes so that
p-p-d's notion of the active profile is always correct.

Thinking more about this always doing the notify seems
like the right thing to do to me.

2. Once we have an answer to 1. we need to documented the
expected behavior in Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-platform_profile

3. If we go for doing a notify on any change, then we need
to update the existing drivers to do this.

Regards,

Hans
