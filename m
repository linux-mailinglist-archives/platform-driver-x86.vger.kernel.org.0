That is a good find, thank you for digging into this and finding this.

But it seems we have a typical case of the microsoft/intel example DSDT code being
blindly copied everywhere here too:

The chassis-type check was originally introduced by you in:
commit de9647efeaa9 ("platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Only activate tablet mode switch on 2-in-1's")

     Some laptops such as the XPS 9360 support the intel-vbtn INT33D6
     interface but don't initialize the bit that intel-vbtn uses to
     represent switching tablet mode.

     By running this only on real 2-in-1's it shouldn't cause false
     positives.

     Fixes: 30323fb6d5 ("Support tablet mode switch")

I have a XPS 9360 (which is not 2-in-1) acpidump and that has:

         Device (CIND)
         {
             Name (_HID, "INT33D3" /* Intel GPIO Buttons */)  // _HID: Hardware ID
             Name (_CID, "PNP0C60" /* Display Sensor Device */)  // _CID: Compatible ID
             Method (_STA, 0, Serialized)  // _STA: Status
             {
                 If ((OSYS >= 0x07DC))
                 {
                     Return (0x0F)
                 }

                 Return (Zero)
             }
         }

And on an asus e200ha (also not a 2-in-1), where we were seeing
similar problems, but then using asus custom WMI interface for
getting SW_TABLET_MODE I see:

         Device (CIND)
         {
             Name (_HID, "INT33D3" /* Intel GPIO Buttons */)  // _HID: Hardware ID
             Name (_CID, "PNP0C60" /* Display Sensor Device */)  // _CID: Compatible ID
             Method (_STA, 0, Serialized)  // _STA: Status
             {
                 Return (0x0F)
             }
         }

I have quite a few DSDTs (mostly byt/cht tablets or 2-in-1s though) and
65 of them define a "PNP0C60" device and only 1 unconditionally
returns 0 from the _STA method for this device. Most others have
an OSYS check. Some also check for some other, presumably BIOS
configured variable, but by far most always return 0x0F, or do
so after an OSYS check which will be true in our case.

So I'm afraid that almost all devices which have the intel-vbtn (INT33D6)
ACPI device will also have a PNP0C60 device with the exact same
_STA method as found on the XPS 9360 and that this thus is not
helpful.

Regards,

Hans
