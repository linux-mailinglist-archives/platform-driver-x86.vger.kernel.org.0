OK, I think for the purpose of 6.13 then this series minus the last 
patch probably makes sense.

I also think the first patch should ideally come in 6.12 if Hans is OK 
with that.  As 6.12 is probably going to be the next LTS we'll want 
hardware supported as widely as possible within stable rules.
