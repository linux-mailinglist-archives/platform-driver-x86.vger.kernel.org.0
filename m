I will remove the CONFIG_DELL_PRIVACY from V4 patch and allow it to run 
if CONFIG_DELL_PRIVACY is not set, the result will be a no-op.

There is a discussion for the channel mute changing behavior.
If the anyone of value[0] or value[1] is 1, it means mic is NOT muted
The muted state will be LED_ON state need to set.

I have moved this part code to the local definition of 
rt715_set_amp_gain_put and removed from rt715_priv.
new code will be like this in V4.
