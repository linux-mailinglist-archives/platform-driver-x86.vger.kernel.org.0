I'm cool with this. Enrico?

I may have some time imminently to have a stab at a new patch. Obviously any help structuring this
would be appreciated - it feels clumsy using the existing detection mechanism, I think whatever I
come up with you should kick back and recommend a new board detection structure, but perhaps we can
shortcut that step with a few comments up front?

Cheers
