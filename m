Yup.  this looks like fancy memory to logging debug traces that will survive a
warmboot.  So why is the scope of writing such traces limited to just this
file?  Kindof looks like a useful debug hack done to solving a suspend/resume
crash.  Yet, you are tring to upstream it.  Shouldn't this be more generalized
if its going to be upstreamed?
