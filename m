I added such a validation step.

So far the 0-returning sensors have not been at the end of the list but in the
middle. Is it worth building logic to properly probe a bitmask of useful
sensors?

I added a DMI-based whitelist and asked users to submit their DMI information.

The serials seem not to be too critical on these boards:

/sys/class/dmi/id/board_serial:Default string
/sys/class/dmi/id/chassis_serial:Default string
/sys/class/dmi/id/product_serial:Default string

I must have overread this one, but yes that's also what I had in mind.

Sounds good.
