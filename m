+Receiving Events
+================
+
+Events can be received by reading from the device-file. The are represented by
+the |ssam_cdev_event| datatype.
+
+Before events are available to be read, however, the desired notifiers must be
+registered via the ``SSAM_CDEV_NOTIF_REGISTER`` IOCTL. Notifiers are, in
+essence, callbacks, called when the EC sends an event. They are, in this
+interface, associated with a specific target category and device-file-instance.
+They forward any event of this category to the buffer of the corresponding
+instance, from which it can then be read.
+
+Notifiers themselves do not enable events on the EC. Thus, it may additionally
+be necessary to enable events via the ``SSAM_CDEV_EVENT_ENABLE`` IOCTL. While
+notifiers work per-client (i.e. per-device-file-instance), events are enabled
+globally, for the EC and all of its clients (regardless of userspace or
+non-userspace). The ``SSAM_CDEV_EVENT_ENABLE`` and ``SSAM_CDEV_EVENT_DISABLE``
+IOCTLs take care of reference counting the events, such that an event is
+enabled as long as there is a client that has requested it.
+
+Note that enabled events are not automatically disabled once the client
+instance is closed. Therefore any client process (or group of processes) should
+balance their event enable calls with the corresponding event disable calls. It
+is, however, perfectly valid to enable and disable events on different client
+instances. For example, it is valid to set up notifiers and read events on
+client instance ``A``, enable those events on instance ``B`` (note that these
+will also be received by A since events are enabled/disabled globally), and
+after no more events are desired, disable the previously enabled events via
+instance ``C``.

+``SSAM_CDEV_NOTIF_REGISTER``
+----------------------------
+
+Defined as ``_IOW(0xA5, 2, struct ssam_cdev_notifier_desc)``.
+
+Register a notifier for the event target category specified in the given
+notifier description with the specified priority. Notifiers registration is
+required to receive events, but does not enable events themselves. After a
+notifier for a specific target category has been registered, all events of that
+category will be forwarded to the userspace client and can then be read from
+the device file instance. Note that events may have to be enabled, e.g. via the
+``SSAM_CDEV_EVENT_ENABLE`` IOCTL, before the EC will send them.
+
+Only one notifier can be registered per target category and client instance. If
+a notifier has already been registered, this IOCTL will fail with ``-EEXIST``.
+
+Notifiers will automatically be removed when the device file instance is
+closed.
+
+``SSAM_CDEV_NOTIF_UNREGISTER``
+------------------------------
+
+Defined as ``_IOW(0xA5, 3, struct ssam_cdev_notifier_desc)``.
+
+Unregisters the notifier associated with the specified target category. The

+registered for this client instance and the given category, this IOCTL will
+fail with ``-ENOENT``.

+--------------------------
+
+Defined as ``_IOW(0xA5, 4, struct ssam_cdev_event_desc)``.
+
+Enable the event associated with the given event descriptor.
+
+Note that this call will not register a notifier itself, it will only enable
+events on the controller. If you want to receive events by reading from the
+device file, you will need to register the corresponding notifier(s) on that
+instance.
+
+Events are not automatically disabled when the device file is closed. This must
+be done manually, via a call to the ``SSAM_CDEV_EVENT_DISABLE`` IOCTL.
+
+``SSAM_CDEV_EVENT_DISABLE``
+---------------------------
+
+Defined as ``_IOW(0xA5, 5, struct ssam_cdev_event_desc)``.
+
+Disable the event associated with the given event descriptor.
+
+Note that this will not unregister any notifiers. Events may still be received
+and forwarded to user-space after this call. The only safe way of stopping
+events from being received is unregistering all previously registered
+notifiers.
