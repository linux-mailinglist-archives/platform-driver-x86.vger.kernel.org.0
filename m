I agree (that the other patches are for 5.11) talking about merging
this series patch 2 is a mfd patch and patches 3-5 are drivers/platform/x86
patches.

Lee, FYI I'm taking over drivers/platform/x86 maintainership from Andy.

I suggest that we merge the entire series through a single tree
(with acks or reviewed-by-s from the other maintainer)
either through the mfd tree or through the drivers/platform/x86
tree. Since most changes are in drivers/platform/x86 the latter
probably makes more sense, but either way works for me.
So how would you like to proceed with this series ?

Regards,

Hans
