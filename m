I think you can simply omit what you don't have. In your case,
I imagine you'll have something like this:

  static const struct hwmon_channel_info *info[] =3D {
    HWMON_CHANNEL_INFO(fan, HWMON_F_INPUT, HWMON_F_INPUT),
    HWMON_CHANNEL_INFO(pwm, HWMON_PWM_ENABLE),
    NULL
  };

  static const struct hwmon_ops ops =3D {
    .is_visible =3D ...,
    .read       =3D ...,
    .write      =3D ...,
  };

  static const struct hwmon_chip_info chip_info =3D {
    .ops  =3D &ops,
    .info =3D info,
  };

I believe the proper way to expose that is via a pwmN_enable attribute on t=
he
hwmon device, this should be created by the hwmon subsystem when it sees th=
e

  HWMON_CHANNEL_INFO(pwm, HWMON_PWM_ENABLE),

channel in the info struct.

If both fans are controlled by one switch, I think it's fine to just have a
single pwmN_enable attribute. But Guenter can probably tell you more.

For this attribute the value 2 means automatic, 1 means manual, 0 means ful=
l speed
as far as I'm aware (at least this is what thinkpad_acpi does). If manual f=
an
control is not available, returning -EOPNOTSUPP is probably fine.
