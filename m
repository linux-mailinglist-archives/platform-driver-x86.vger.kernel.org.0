Which keys generate these two scancodes? Or how have you been able to
trigger these scancodes (in case they are not generated by key press)?

It is important to know for which key or event or feature we need to
include this patch and therefore what feature is currently
non-functional on that laptop.

I already wrote that more developers would not be happy about this
change. I would rather to see e.g. that Randy's suggestion with 0xffff
check as increasing memory usage.

Looking at the last two lines... and for me it looks like that 0x00FF
and 0xFFFF are just "placeholders" or special values for unknown /
custom / unsupported / reserved / special / ... codes.

It is really suspicious why first 38 values are defined, then there is
gap, then one value 255 and then huge gap to 65535.

Mario, this looks like some mapping table between internal Dell BIOS key
code and standard Linux key code. Are you able to get access to some
documentation which contains explanation of those Dell key numbers?
It could really help us to understand these gaps and what is correct
interpretation of these numbers.

E.g. I remember that pressing Fn+Q or Fn+W on some Dell Latitude
generates code 255, which could prove my thesis about "special codes"
(which are probably not found in e.g. Windows or Linux mapping tables).

Hint: specifying git send-email with '--to' argument instead of '--cc'
should help.
