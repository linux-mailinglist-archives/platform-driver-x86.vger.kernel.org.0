It's ok either way. You can send me an updated version off-list.

Yes, thanks -- I followed this issue first:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/1671.

That's a good tip. The laptop I tested this on (Lenovo Legion S7
15ACH6) originally shipped with:

UEFI: LENOVO v: HACN27WW date: 08/02/2021

There is an update to version HACN31WW (see lenovo support:
https://support.lenovo.com/ro/en/downloads/ds550201-bios-update-for-windows=
-10-64-bit-legion-s7-15ach6)
-- which I applied, however, the issue was not addressed, which seems
to be expected given the rather short /changelog:
HACN31WW
BIOS Notification    :
1. Fixed
 1) N/A.
2. Add
  1) Add BOE0A1C support with Cookie and DR Key
3. Modified
  1) Modify MinShortTerm & MinLongTerm PowerLimit value
EC Notification      :
1. Fixed
  1) None.
2. Add
   1) None.
3. Modified
  1)None.

I posted a link to this mailing list to
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/1671, so people can be
aware and try to test.
