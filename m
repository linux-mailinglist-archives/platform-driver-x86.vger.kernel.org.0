Thank you for looking into this in detail, Ilpo! I tried to address
everything you mentioned in my v2 of this patch, but will comment on
each of your comments below so it will hopefully be more clear with
exactly what I changed, where, and the reasoning behind it.

After comments from Armin (which I agree with!) I have actually just
completely removed all of the pr_* functions including these macros in
the v2 of this patch, and for detailed buffer traces I have
implemented a new tracepoint system + event for samsung_galaxybook. I
assume now as the format of dev_dbg / warn / error looks correct
without defining pr_fmt(), it is also not needed ? (I have removed it
for now in v2 but can add it back if it is needed).

Thanks for catching this; hopefully I have now fixed everything to use
reverse xmas tree ordering in the entire module. Please feel free to
let me know if I missed anything!

This was originally done as a "workaround" to get a device description
from the "_STR" method in the same way that ACPI's device_sysfs.c did
it, ... but yes I agree it was not at all optimal and because I have
actually removed everything to do with ACPI fan devices in v2 of this
patch, all of this is gone now, too :)

Thank you for pointing this out; I have hopefully switched everything
to use dev_* functions for printing (and removed most of them,
actually) but please feel free to mention if I seem to have missed or
should adjust anything.

Good catch here, as well! I have renamed these variables a bit; now
this is called "out_buf" (and the incoming buffer is called "in_buf")
so hopefully it is super clear but please feel free to make any other
suggestion.

Now in v2 I changed this to `buf.guds[2] =3D value ? 1 : 0` -- please
let me know if that is what you had in mind otherwise I can adjust
this to anything!

Really great recommendation, but even here as I removed all of this
stuff as well then there is no longer a need for string_choices.h I
think!

Yes, agreed, and I removed all of these (but please feel free to say

Actually the comments like these were intended to be a sort of
separator for all of the related functions etc related to each
individual attribute (e.g. "usb_charge" as an attribute has 4
functions and a device_attribute defined, then the next set of
functions+attribute are for "allow_recording" etc). I left this empty
line so that the comment would not be associated only with the single
usb_charge_acpi_set function but instead could be considered a sort of
label for the entire grouping.

How should comments like this be formatted or does it just not even
make sense to have them at all and they should be removed ?

Good idea, now I have handled this in the v2 of the patch as follows:

if (value > 100)
        return -EINVAL;
/* if setting to 100, should be set to 0 (no threshold) */
if (value =3D=3D 100)
        value =3D 0;

Does this make sense now or do you see anything that should be adjusted her=
e?

>

>

And regarding this, the device requires that you send 0 to represent
that the feature is "turned off", so to speak (no threshold is enabled
and the battery will charge all the way to 100%). So yes, in my mind,
we want to send 0 to the device if you are attempting to set either 0
or 100. Also I seem to recall that I tried to dig into how this is
handled in upower and the coming features in GNOME, and have a vague
memory that I saw somewhere in there that they were also converting
100 to a 0, but now I am having a bit of trouble finding this again.
Do you know if it would be better to have this driver provide an
interface where "100" means "no threshold" and that it should be
translated within the driver (that samsung_galaxybook sends a 0 to the
ACPI in case the user has requested "100" ?) or is it better if "0"
means "no threshold/charge to 100%" (or both?)?

I can also do some testing with the device to see if it accepts the
value 100 anyway, and how it behaves, though I would be a little
concerned with this longer term as it is not how the driver and
settings applications work in Windows (they are hard-coded with a
toggle and it always sets either 0 (off) or 80 (on)), and I could see
where even if it works today, sending the value of 100 to mean "off"
could be altered by potential BIOS updates?

Here I have tried to look over and make sure to use "err" for

Removed all fan stuff from the driver in v2 so all of this is gone now anyw=
ay :)

>

Though the fan stuff is removed, I have done this now with the battery
charge control attribute. The reason in this new case is to be able to
give a pointer to the "samsung_galaxybook" struct so that the handle
can be grabbed from this private data and avoid using a global pointer
variable.

Good catch, this was a total oversight. Now in v2 of this patch I have
changed this to a more typical int return code function (returning
-ENODATA) and the value is assigned to a pointer that the caller
passes in. Please let me know if anything looks fishy with this or it
seems ok now!

All of this was just for printing the strings out in the debug
information, and really not actually necessary. So I have removed it
all, now.

Agreed and now I have added a new int "mapped_profiles" and tweaked
this logic a bit so hopefully it is slightly more self-explanatory.
Please say if it seems like I am still missing the mark on this one!
