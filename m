No, it's because of the ID table type which leaves there.

Basically you have to find a compromise between what to include and
what to not. At least those I have mentioned are kinda core stuff that
usually should be included explicitly in the modules like this driver.

Yes, that counts as FW and as you noticed out of the Linux kernel realm.

Not only, the _MAX in the above enum is correct in leaving commas out.

Strange indentation, btw.
