I think Richard can tell us best and he should receive this mail.

There is no secret hidden in there and the binary is typically openly
shared by the vendor through update sites or mechanisms. Actually it
would be better from a security perspective to access all of it to be
able to compare it to the official versions and check it for malicious
modifications, which is becoming ever more relevant in the wake of
recent CVEs about supply-chain attacks. Doing so would be a possible
use beyond fwupd and I am specifically speaking about the open source
converged security suite by 9elements.

That would really be great and I'd already like to thank you for being
open about going down this path. I think Mauro is willing to
collaborate on this front, correct me if I am wrong.

Yes of course, I think to not endanger users with malfunctions caused
by code we produce is of our mutual interest here and we should make
sure to be absolutely serious about it.
