What happens when reading these ?  Maybe they should be write only ?

I don't understand what this file does, the description suggests (to me) that the
OS (userspace?) writes 1 to it to indicate it is taking over control from the firmware,
but then it says that this is "read only" ?

Please make the doc here a bit more clear about what this file is for.

What happens if the software is responsible and it enables all line modules and
that leads to the system going over its power-budget ?
