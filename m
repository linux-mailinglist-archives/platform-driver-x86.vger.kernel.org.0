This looks good, but looking at this a second time I still
have one open question:

What is the difference between removing a certificate and
switching back to password auth?

Looking at the WMI calls there are 4 different calls:

LENOVO_SET_BIOS_CERT_GUID
LENOVO_UPDATE_BIOS_CERT_GUID
LENOVO_CLEAR_BIOS_CERT_GUI
LENOVO_CERT_TO_PASSWORD_GUID

Going by these names I guess there can be only 1 certificate
otherwise I would expect:

1. add/remove naming
2. update to take an id of which certificate to replace

So I guess that LENOVO_CLEAR_BIOS_CERT_GUI disables all
authentication. IOW, installing a cert replaces/clears
the supervisor password and the difference between
clearing the certificate and cert-to-password is that
after clearing it we end up with no supervisor password
set, where as cert-to-password sets the passed in password
as the new supervisor password?

Or does clearing the certificate fall back to the old
supervisor password if one was set?  (that might lead to
some interesting issues if users clear the certificate
many years after the password was last used ...)

Given where we are in the cycle I was planning on adding
this to my review-hans branch so that it could maybe still
get into 5.18, but given the above questions as well
the remark about the test X1 BIOS you are using I've
a feeling it would be better to give this some more time
to bake and target 5.19 instead. Do you agree ?

Regardless  of this is 5.18 or 5.19 material can you? :

a) confirm that I've understood how the clearing vs cert-to-password
   works correctly ?
b) confirm that despite you using a test BIOS the WMI API for this is
   final and that it will *not* change before there are production
   BIOS-es with this ?
c) submit a version to clarify the clearing vs cert-to-password thing, e.g.:

@@ -276,6 +276,8 @@ Description:

Hans
