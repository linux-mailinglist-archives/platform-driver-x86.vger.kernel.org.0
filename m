The document claims these gentlemen to be your authorized 
representatives, and the power of attorney states that you are 
already deceased.  It further states that your death was due to 
lung cancer, with your date of death being January 27th, 2020.

They have now submitted a new account to replace the receiving 
account that was in the original claim of funds. These funds have 
remained unclaimed for quite some time and the need for 
resolution is pressing. Below is the new account they have 
submitted.
