The actual patch and associated commit message don't contain any characters that require more than 7 bits to encode, but the eventually sent e-mail does, since I added the information about the review revisions. Presumably git send-email is evaluating the encoding before the edit stage, but not after. sendemail.assume8bitEncoding is unset in my git config; I'll explicitly set it to UTF-8.

I agree that BACKLIGHT_FIRMWARE is more appropriate, that is the same
as what drivers/acpi/acpi_video.c uses and this is in essence operating
at the same level.
