I'm not sure I understand why the platform security needs to be turned
off? Sorry if that was already mentioned somewhere in the thread, I did
not read all of them throughly.

I think exposing /dev/mem opens another can of worms that we want to
avoid.

Is there anything preventing to add a sane interface from say the
intel-spi driver (can be something else too) that exposes the minimal
set you need? That can be in the mainline kernel and is secure (and
safe) enough that distros (and users) can enable it?

Don't we already expose some of the EFI stuff under /sys/firmware?

No that's not the reason. The real reason I'm concerned (as the author
and maintainer of that thing) is that last time the driver was
accidentally enabled in Ubuntu (around 2019) there was a driver bug
(which was fixed already but it was not yet in the Ubuntu kernel) that
turned some Lenovo based systems' BIOSes to read-only. It has nothing to
do with my employer or hardware errata/misdesign. I just don't want to
spend yet another Christmas holiday trying to fix angry peoples laptops :(

Having said that the hardware sequencer used in the recent CPUs should
be much safer in that sense. It should not allow things like this to
happen (the affected systems used software based sequencer).
