Sure I'll add this.

I need to add a comment for this. Support will be added back when a device is
added that needs it. Current devices do not.

Yes. Sorry I used "list" loosely.

That's correct. There were several deviations in implementation between the
first devices and this is how they were resolved. The OOBMSM device doesn't
require any of these workarounds, hence why it provides no info. Though we may
use this structure in the future for actual platform data.

Yes and yes.

Understood.
