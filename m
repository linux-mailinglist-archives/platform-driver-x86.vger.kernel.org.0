Tested it. Nope. In fact there is no code in the DSDT to handle the wakeup
case. Or rather, only some partial lines of code are left over from that.
That functionality is definitely non-functional on this laptop.

In addition the Microsoft specification lists _PRW as being a required
method. This is missing. Only _STA (which does something funky based on
variables set based on _OSI, haven't bothered figuring that out yet), _HID,
_UID and GHID exist as methods on the button objects.

Sure, we may have talked past each other, as this is what I also believe I
suggested. I just don't see how I can possibly implement the wakeup
handling part of this, as no laptop I own has that. Unless you know some
else who has a laptop that would allow testing that part.

Would a sensible option be to only implement support for key presses while
the laptop is awake? If someone comes along with a laptop that has the
support for these buttons waking from sleep they can add that missing
functionality at that point. (It seems rather unlikely that will happen
though: I get the feeling that this type of button never became a hit and
is mostly a forgotten relic of the past. And if no one came along and
bothered to add support in the decade+ since it was introduced, it was
probably quite rare back then as well.)

I think we might be slightly talking past each other here. I absolutely
agree with your idea. My only worry is that toshiba_acpi returning 80%
might not be the right choice. This could be model dependent.

Since I only have a sample size of one, it could even depend on the current
condition of the battery for all I know (though that is probably not
likely). The Windows software and the manual do not specify any sort of
percentage. It is just documented as a mode that prolongs battery life
while reducing full charge basically. Without putting any qualifiers on
"how much".

An option would be to return 80% for the Z830, and the string "unknown" for
other models. Though I guess there is a risk of breaking user space
software that only expects numeric values, so it may be a no-go.

I guess the user space software using this interface consists of *at least*
"tlp" and whatever KDE uses to handle it ("powerdevil" I belive?).
