No, what was proposed for regulator was to duplicate all the the DT
binding code in the regulator framework so it parses fwnodes then have
an API for encoding fwnodes from C data structures at runtime.  The bit
where the data gets joined up with the devices isn't the problem, it's
the duplication and fragility introduced by encoding everything into
an intermediate representation that has no purpose and passing that
around which is the problem.

I propose what I suggested above, providing a way to attach platform
data to firmware provided devices.  Don't bother with an intermediate
encoding, just use platform data.  Or just put quirks in the drivers
like all the other systems using ACPI for platforms where it's not a
good fit.
