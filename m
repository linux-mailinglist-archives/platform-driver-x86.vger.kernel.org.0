Actually i am currently working on decoding the BMOF format based on the bmfdec utility
developed by Pali.

The issue with exposing those WMI methods to userspace like how it is done under Windows
would create a massive security issue since most WMI methods are security sensitive and
quite fragile when presented with invalid/unusual input data (i fully blame the BIOS developers
here, they simply do not care about this).

That is why we have to stick with WMI drivers.

IMHO if the firmware provides min and max limits for settings then the kernel should
enforce them. The reason for this is that the firmware might only be tested with the
official Lenovo OEM software and might therefor rely on the userspace software to not
exceed those limits.
If we allow a userspace application to exceed those limits then the firmware could break
and/or behave erratically.

Of course we could add a module param to tell the driver to ignore those limits. But such
a thing is totally optional and can be added later when the need arises.

Your point has some merit, as WMI calls are indeed quite slow. Caching the values would indeed increase performance.
However i still suggest that the driver actually enforces those limits, as the firmware might rely on this.
