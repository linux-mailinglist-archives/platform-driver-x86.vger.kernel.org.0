p.s.

About the type part of the proposed sysfs API for this, the idea
here is that e.g. the Intel pstate driver could also export a
performance-profile interface, mirroring the custom interface it
currently has for this.

The performance-profile-daemon (p-p-d) Bastien is working on already
talks to the pstate driver in some cases.  Currently it does this using
the pstate drivers own/custom API, but that does not really scale. If
ARM or AMD chips get similar functionality in the future then ideally
these would export a /sys/class/performance-profile with a type
of "cpu" and then p-p-d would just need to talk to the performance-profile
API, instead of needing to have its own internal HAL to deal with
different CPU vendors.

Regards,

Hans
