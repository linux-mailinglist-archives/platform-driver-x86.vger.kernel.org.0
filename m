Although not a deal breaker in this instance, we need to think of this
as a new driver since the expectations between Platform and MFD may
well be different.

Great.  That would help bring the driver into line with other drivers
currently residing in MFD.

Maybe Regmap will solve this too.

SYSFS entries require documenting in Documentation.

Hmm... that is an issue.  However, since it's not changing any
existing behaviour, I won't make it an issue for *this* set of
changes.  Please justify it in the commit log though please.

Not sure I understand.  If the driver is unbound then rebound, the
device resources will be re-parsed, no?

No, that's not correct either, since we haven't run out of memory.

-EINVAL and -ENODEV are common.

Maybe consider dev_warn() and change the working to make it not seem
like a failure.

Could you clarify that in the comments please?

"probing" a library doesn't sound right.

Looking at the code, I think this should be a device.

That would be ideal, thanks.

You're a smart chap, I'm sure you'll figure it out. ;)
