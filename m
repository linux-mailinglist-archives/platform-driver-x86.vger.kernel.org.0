Ack, so lets just go with KEY_CONFIG here.

Again event_id 29, I really think we need a patch to just treat
event_id 29 the same as HPWMI_BEZEL_BUTTON.

And we could/should map 0x21a7 to KEY_FN_ESC, then userspace could
potentially do something with this if it wants.

Good.

Ideally we would silence these by adding a hwdb entry mapping them to be
ignored, see:

https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/master/hwdb.d/60-keyboard.hwdb#L333

(the Dell Inspiron 1520 and Latitude 2110 entry in case the line numbers
change due to new commits) for an example of this.

Note please group any new 60-keyboard.hwdb entries for this together with
the already existing HP entries.

Likely there is some firmware interface for this, but possibly we first need
to make some call to tell the firmware that we are capable of dealing with
this. Anyways kbd backlight support (including registering a:
/sys/class/leds/hp_foo::kbd_backlight/ LED-class device for this so that
e.g. the GNOME3 integration for this can work is something which is currently
not supported at all. So way more then just detecting the key-press is missing
and this really is a completely separate project.

So this is handled in firmware.

Nice, these should be mapped to KEY_F22 for when the touchpad gets
turned on, so use F22 for 0x121a9 I guess) and to KEY_F23 for when
the touchpad gets turned off. This will make at least GNOME3 show
OSD notifications showing that the touchpad is on/off like it does
for volume mute/unmute. I realize that using F22/F23 for this may
look a but weird, but userspace has re-purposed a bunch of the
high F-key numbers to avoid the key-codes higher then 247 not being
supported in X11 problem.

I know about the following re-purposed F2# keys for this:

F20: mic-mute toggle
F21: touchpad on/off toggle (to be handled by software)
F22: touchpad on (notification for this being handled in firmware)
F23: touchpad off (notification for this being handled in firmware)

You can see these being re-defined like this in:

/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/inet

(search for FK20)

Hmm, can you explain what this does does it disable the Windows (aka meta/super)
key to avoid accidentally pressing it ?
