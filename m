But this is not the issue of ACPI, right? Maybe you should stream the
energy to complain and file bugs against vendors who do not know how
to cook ACPI?

Isn't it applicable to all firmwares? Have you tried to avoid wireless
firmwares (rhetorical question)? My point is that we have to live with
that fortunately or unfortunately.

As I said, look into the root cause, while I admit that the ACPI spec
is easy to abuse / misinterpret (in some cases).

I haven't got it. How do you deduct that it's solely for Chrome? Even
I'm puzzled with this Yet Another Not So Portable Idea. And above is
my speculation about the roots of it. I can't explain it any other
way.

ACPI has nothing to do with any solution to be "junk". If one doesn't
know how to cook it, it doesn't prevent them from cooking it in a
better way.
