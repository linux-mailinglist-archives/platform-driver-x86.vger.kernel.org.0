This indeed is much better and a great cleanup, thanks.

The thinkpad_acpi code talks to the ACPI object representing the
ThinkPad embedded-controller and that has a lot of different sub-functionalities
which may or may not be present depending on the model laptop as well
as on the hw-configuration of the model.

The code is organized around all the different sub-functions with there
being a separate init + exit function for each sub-function, including
with first detecting in the init function if the functionality is present
(e.g. don't register SW_TABLETMODE_SW evdev reporting when the device
is not convertible / don register a WWAN rfkill if there is no WWAN modem).

Many (but not all) of the sub-functions come with a few sysfs-attributes
under /sys/bus/platform/devices/thinkpad_acpi/ many of the separate
function_init functions therefor call sysfs_create_group() for their own
set of sysfs-attributes, if the function is present on the machine.

Right, that results in a very nice cleanup. But there all the attributes
were always registered before the patch so throwing them together in a
ATTRIBUTE_GROUPS(hp_wmi) makes a ton of sense.

Here however we have all the separate function_init() blocks each
conditionally adding their own attributes if the function is present,
so that is different.

Currently there already are 8 separate sysfs_create_group() calls in
the thinkpad_acpi code, so even if we want to refactor this (I'm not
sure that we do) then doing so would fall outside of the scope of this
patch.

Greg, since this resolves / defers your remark and since this otherwise
is a nice cleanup I'm going to merge this version of this patch now.

Regards,

Hans
