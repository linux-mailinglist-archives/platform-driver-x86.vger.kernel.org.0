Yes, the two screen type. I am focusing on the keyboard for now. I am
waiting for a user to test the changes. This series helps with
maintaining keyboard brightness on that. Hopefully it will work as the
keyboard transitions from USB to bluetooth.

If there are issues with the screen brightness, I will rereview your
patch and if it is needed adapt it and coby you.
