I confirmed that it works on my X1 with limited functionality, but don't have a "any type" device to test available. (In fact, I don't know whether such a device even exists.) IIUC it can also easily cover type 2 "Helix" and type 3 "Thinkpad 10" with the functionality available on those types. Since I cannot test, I didn't enable that in my patch; but it should be a matter of checking for return values 2 and 3 and adding an appropriate case in hotkey_get_tablet_mode.

> I realized that the device also emits 0x60c0 (TP_HKEY_EV_TABLET_CHANGED) when the keyboard cover is attached or detached, yet *not* when it's folded. I don't quite get why I nevertheless receive only one notification to userspace according to acpi_listen, despite the fact that the 0x60c0 handler also calls tpacpi_input_send_tabletsw and hotkey_tablet_mode_notify_change. Is there a deduplication behind the scenes?

Yes the input subsystem layer will not send events when nothing has changed.

Hmm, that is a bit of a problem I would prefer to avoid having to deny-list things in intel_vbtn.

So do the 2 behave exactly the same? Also wrt when the kbd is folded behind the kbd. IOW
are the 2 SW_TABLET_MODE reports fully in sync in all possible states:

1. Just the tablet
2. Tablet + keyboard attached, keyboard in use
3. Tablet + keyboard attached, keyboard folded away behind tablet 

?

> On the other hand, userspace should expect duplicate messages to some degree and use a hysteresis approach anyway. Every now and then, the contact of the magnetic plug is not established perfectly on the first attempt. So perhaps not really an issue.

The only userspace consumer of this which I know is mutter (part of gnome-shell) and it
will just take the value from the last event. So if the 2 are always in sync then
the event send by the second input-dev will essentially be a no-op since the value will
be the same as the other event.

We do need to resolve the question of how to handle this before I can merge the patch,
atm I think that just having it reported twice is fine (as long as both reports are in
sync).

Regards,

Hans
