 Daniel might be able to trigger the fan on that laptop so it will actually=
 spin and will dissipate-out heat from the system, without the relying on t=

This is basically what my patch does. If the ECRD/ECWR method handles
are NULL, thinkpad_acpi's acpi_ec_{read,write} functions fall back to
the regular ACPI EC helpers you mentioned.

Speaking of which, does anyone know why these private helper functions
exist in the first place? The code seems to use them interchangeably.
Even in the fan control code, there are places where the regular EC
helpers are called directly. Can we get away with always doing that?

Back to the issue at hand, is there someone we could ask if the X380Y
even supports manual fan control in the first place? My debugging
efforts are starting to look like a wild goose chase.

The thermal sensors and fan PWM readings now work, which is better
than nothing, but it would be good to get to the bottom of this.

All the best,

Daniel
