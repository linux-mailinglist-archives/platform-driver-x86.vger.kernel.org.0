Hi All,

These 2 patches are an upstream submission of a patch titled:
"Intel Atom suspend: add debug check for S0ix blockers"

Which I have been carrying in my personal kernel tree for years now.
This code originally comes from the latte-l-oss branch of:
https://github.com/MiCode/Xiaomi_Kernel_OpenSource

And has been posted on upstream mailinglists before by
Johannes Stezenbach, whose authorship I have kept for
the 2 base patches and has been reposted by Takashi Iwai
and at one point in time I picked this up from Takashi's
reposting as can be seen from the S-o-b lines. Unfortunately
I cannot find the original postings, so I have no link to
those.

The original version of this added some ugly hooks into
the intel_idle driver which I presume is why these patches
never go anywhere upstream.

With the new acpi_s2idle_dev_ops and acpi_register_lps0_dev()
functionality this functionality can now be implemented cleanly
and that is what this patch-series does.

x86/tip maintainers, it is probably the cleanest if I merge
this entire series through the pdx86 tree (*). Can I have your
ack for merging patch 4/4 through the pdx86 tree ?

Regards,

Hans

*) Andy recently mentioned that it might be a good idea to move
some of the arch/x86/platform code to drivers/platform/x86,
arch/x86/platform/atom/punit_atom_debug.c which is a completely
standalone driver definitly is a good candidate for this
