If you can work on this that would be great.

I think that just compile testing them is fine.

I have a slight preference for keeping the Toshiba changes.

As discussed below these "quick start" buttons
normally are only intended to wake up the laptop
and then immediately on wakeup start a specific app
tied to the button (IIRC). But at least on the Toshiba
the toshiba_acpi driver's special "poke" of the firmware
makes the button also send events normally, so that it
can actually be used as a normal button.

IMHO the Toshiba code is helpful in documenting the need
for such a special code (maybe extend it with a comment?).

With all that said if you don't want to submit
the Toshiba part compile-tested only, then I understand
and you can omit it.

See above IIRC what was discussed last time this is
an intentional (mis)feature of these buttons. Chances
are there might be some workaround for this for HP too,
but that will likely be tricky to find.

Hans
