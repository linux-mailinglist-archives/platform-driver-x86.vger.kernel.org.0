OMGs, not again ...

No idea whats the actual difference between i210 and i211 from OS pov.
But if they need a different or newer driver, this can cause a hell of
trouble in the industrial field ... very unprofessional.

The problem is: we can't rely on frequent firmware updates in the field,
those things require a full field roll.

Well, we used to have some (very limited) support for APUv2 in the APUv1
driver (v1 and v2 have completely different SoCs). No ACPI support back 
then. This driver used a weird model specific naming, that didn't make
much sense at all (see my other mail). Since it blocked gpio access
(eg. no access to the front key), nobody really uses it (didn't find any
distro that actually enabled it).

People out there did ugly hacks by directly writing to raw registeres 
from userland. Even worse: pcengines advised guileless users to do so.

When implementing the full apuv2/3 support, I specifically chose a 
consistent and future proof naming scheme that does use semantically
matching and not model specific naming.

Some years ago, long after the new driver was mainlined and distro
shipped, pcengines suddenly began adding ACPI LED entries to their
firmware - using yet another, also model specific, naming scheme.
Haven't tried this myself, but got reports various reports, some
couldn't use my drivers anymore while others had dupliated LEDs.
But no support or other gpio lines, eg. the front key. Some releases
later, this been removed again.

Well, we're actually talking about several different naming schemes:

a) the ancient apuv1 driver
b) my driver
c) several firmware versions

Just checked their recent coreboot branch:

They actually reinintroced their weird model specific naming again and 
also breaking other stuff like front key, rst lines, etc.

Now spent some to time to write them an detailed mail (yet again) and
also informed them how they damaged their own business in the industrial
field this way.

ACK. And they even highjacked the HID of a totally different device that
just happen to be similar enough that these few things happen to work
somehow by mere accident.

This is deeply embedded stuff, some of the lines are used internally in
SoC-specific ways. Playing around with the undocumented lines can lead
to very weird effects ... I have no idea whether some could even lead to
electronical defects (maybe internal LDOs or CLKs), broken microcode,
PSP lockout, ... IOW: bricking the Soc. We'd have to reverse engineer
aegesa blob to get a better understanding. (AMD as usual is very
secretive about this).

That's the reason why I didn't dare to give direct access to the whole
register bank - some regs seem to be totally different things, not
actual gpios.

historical note: the far ancestor of this, from the dark ages, was some
IP with several things like gpio, i2c, clk, which AMD bought in and
integrated into various SoC families. Since then these evolved in
separate ways, just happen to still share some similarities. It seems
even recent Ryzen still have some pieces of it.

I recall something like that. And even more: this would make userland
API model specific. Exactly the kind of things we don't like in the
kernel.

I also recall something about missing wire'ings on certain charges.

Yes, these lines were originally meant as a generic slot reset. Actually
the naming isn't 100% correct, since it's not a pcie channel reset, but
a per-slot line, not per pcie-link.

Unfortunately yes. To get rid of this problem, we'd need some "baseband
subsystem" capable of resetting those devices - here we could link the
baseband's RST signal with the corresponding board specific pcie rst.

But that mixes up semantics and only makes sense when these slots are
really populated this way. This now goes out of scope of this platform
driver, since it doesn't really know what's inside the invidual slots - 
would need another layer of probing.

Since the gpio driver doesn't provide anything on its own, but wants to
be configured by a platform driver, we - technically - could assign
multiple gpio lines to the same hw register. This would give us some
kind of aliasing. But before doing so we really have to check back w/
gpio subsys maintainers whether this could lead to some ugly side
effects.

Define "users". In some twisted ways, power supply of whole cities could
depend on it (sorry for being so mythical, but I'm still under NDA :().

If we do some change here, it should be clear that this may only affect
newer devices, that - at least to my knowledge - aren't used for any
critical applications.

Note that the "never break userland" philosophy is one of the main
success factors of the Linux kernel :p

And the pcengine/3mdeb's ACPI naming is again model specific :(

Is there anybody out here who really enjoys keeping model specific
quirks, that won't be necessary if we (kernel folks) just take care
of some consistent naming ?

Or the pci RST lines (which turned out to be critical in the field).

Canonicalizing this stuff really needs another layer of abstraction
that's capable of understanding the actual semantics (basedband subsys)

Anybody here willing to get his hands dirty on that project ? ;-)

Yes, we had the same problem. Returned them as broken, didn't match the 
spec. (not sure whether I still have one of those lying around)

Any idea what they actually did there ? Actual soldering or just some
configuration issue ?

One of my clients (who also sponsored me for the driver) actually uses 
the RST lines when modem is bitchy for too long. Haven't heared back
from them for quite some time, so they probably didn't have major
trouble (yet).

Latest firmware uses apu[2-7]:led[1-2], depending on which model the was
compiled for (assuming the corresponding define is set correctly - I'm
not entirely sure about that, considering their hackish ways of working
;-)).

Very different situation: we really broke a small handful of people. I
couldn't find a single one. The people I talked with, who did use these
gpios followed the dangerous suggestion from pcengines website, directly
writing to registers from userspace.

Well, that might be okay for you. But I really don't want all people
out there - especially industrial applications - to puzzle around, with
each new board model. That's not my standard of quality.

We all know that firmware developers tend to have much lower quality
(oh, I really don't wanna start talking about what I had to see in
even more rigid fields like medical industry - a case where unthoughtful
overregulation leads to very poor quality), but we can - and should -
do better. The Linux kernel's success largely comes from its high
quality standards.

I don't recall signing-off that. And still NAK on any userland api
changes.

Option b) unregister the brokenly designed acpi stuff and keep things as
they are. Pcengines/3mdeb broke the kernel, and they we're aware of the
problem for years now. Maybe their actual problem is not writing useful
commit messages ... but the guy who dropped the original code back then
was the same who reverted his own commit recently - seems he's got a bad
memory :p

Frankly, I'm beginning to become really upset about these firmware
folks, especially in the acpi area. Rarely seen so much poor work like
there. We're used to that from big corps in the consumer field, but for
a company like pcengines, this is very very disappointing.
