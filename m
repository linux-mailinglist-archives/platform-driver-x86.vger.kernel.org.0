We can make "tme" or whatever string we decide upon, visible only when
the feature is activated - not a problem. Just like we do on AMD.

Can you have a system where some of the memory is crypto-capable and
some of it is not? I've never heard about such a system. At least, on
AMD SME, all your memory gets encrypted...

... or maybe dhansen knows more.

So, you folks feeding us piecemeal all these "requirements" won't get
you very far. So please sit down and write a detailed use case about
which customers, when and what exactly they need extracted from the
system and why.

Because this is not all - there's TDX and SEV and SEV-ES and SEV-SNP and
all those partition and encrypt the system or part of it in a different
way. And I'm sure customers will wanna know about that too. Are they
running in an encrypted guest in a public cloud, what security they
have, blabla, everything you can imagine.

And so we won't be adding a different reporting method for each type of
encryption that happens.

But we don't know what we need to report unless we know the use case.
Which is not in the least clear to me.

Thx.
