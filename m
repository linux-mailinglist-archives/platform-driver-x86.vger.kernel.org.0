[testing]

The struct members are not formatted like Returns: formatting.

a. If I just drop the at-sign, the struct member descriptions all run
together, no breaks between them. Not acceptable IMO.

b. If I use "* *" before each struct member, the struct member
descriptions still run together but there is a "*" separator
character between them.

c. If I end each struct member description with a '.' (just one
leading '*'), the struct member descriptions run together but
there is an ending '.' between them.

d. If I use "* @member" for each struct member, kernel-doc seems
to ignore those lines completely. No output is produced for those
lines.

So I think we are down to using "* *" for each struct member or
using "* member: Description." so that there is a separator between
each struct member description. Do you have a preference?

Example for b:

       read_telem  when  specified,  called by client driver to access PMT data
                   (instead of direct copy).  * pdev:  PCI device reference for
                   the callback's use * guid:  ID of data  to  acccss  *  data:
                   buffer  for  the  data to be copied * off:   offset into the
                   requested buffer * count: size of buffer

Example for c:

       read_telem  when  specified,  called by client driver to access PMT data
                   (instead of direct copy).  pdev:  PCI device  reference  for
                   the  callback's  use.   guid:   ID of data to acccss.  data:
                   Buffer for the data to be copied.  off:    Offset  into  the
                   requested buffer.  count: Size of buffer.

Or we could just drop the patch if you don't care for any of these.

thanks.
