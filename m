It would be good to mention the PMC involvement, because it is
necessary to trigger the issue IIUC.

Apparently, if a Root Port is in D3hot at the time the PMC is called
to reduce the platform power, the PMC takes that as a license to do
something that prevents wakeup signaling from working.

I'm not sure whether or not it is really clear what happens in Windows
nor whether it is relevant for this patch.

The relevant information is that Windows keeps these ports in D0 and
that demonstrably prevents the PMC from using a platform state in
which PCIe wakeup doesn't work.  Therefore Linux needs to do the same
thing, but only if system wakeup is enabled for them (or the devices
underneath).

I would say "but Linux doesn't do that, so ...", because it currently
reads like the quirk was not present which is slightly confusing.

I'd use pcie_find_root_port() here.

Overall, I think that this is much better than the previous
iterations, because it adds the quirk where it is needed and triggers
it under the conditions in which it matters.

So with the above addressed, please feel free to add
