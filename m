I am not sure I am reading this right:
are you telling me that on recent models the windows driver
doesn't issue 0x5d?

I meant people remap keyboards using IP. I am sure there were
(and very probably still are) people doing that.

If it's just aesthetics I don't see much reasons in changing the name.

"the early entry needs to be added anyway ...." has no meaning to me,
please rephrase. Sorry.

But IP does, so I would like to hear confirmation from at least Derek
before the merge that there won't be future issues.

Interpret what I say here as a broad topic, not just name/PER_APP flag:
avoid changing data flow on older models...

Here I apologize for confusion: my comments were mostly about
older models: I absolutely don't want to break those, but if you find a way
to distinguish them from newer models that would give you more freedom with those.

No disable commands unless we find hard evidence those are strictly needed.
