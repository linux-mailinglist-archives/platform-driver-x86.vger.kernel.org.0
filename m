I've been trying to figure out which exact NUC10i3 your NUC is? I
can't find a NUC10i3 that uses Comet Lake -S?

If your NUC isn't actually "-S" variant, then the ACPI device entry
with HID INT3515 should return 0 from its _STA method.

But can you please share the full name of your board (like NUC10i3FNH
or something like that - should read on the bottom of the device).
Also, dmesg output would be useful.

thanks,
