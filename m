Agreed on that 1 driver should not be poking the [wmi_]dev of another
driver. This usually works until it doesn't for some reason so it
should just be avoided.

That would indeed keep the kernel drivers simple, but at the cost of
providing a non standard hwmon interface.

Whatever implementation is written it really MUST follow the standard
hwmon API so that any hwmon tools like the lm_sensors fancontrol script
will work properly.

So NACK from me for exposing fanX_max on a separate hwmon device.

What I think works best in cases like this is to have the wmi-driver
expose a function to retrieve the fan max value.

This function can use a static global array of fan max values +
a global fan_max_values_initialized bool and it can return -EPROBE_DEFER
when the bool is not set yet.

This will also require the ACPI driver to have a Kconfig "depends on"
the WMI driver but that should be fine.

And then the ACPI driver can simply call the exported helper function
to get the max fan values.

This sort of cross driver function calling is not ideal, but it is
better then poking at a struct device owned by another driver.

Or maybe just hardcode the max fan values in the ACPI driver if
it is only 2 models and the next version of the ACPI interface
is supposed to fix this shortcoming ?

Regards,

Hans
