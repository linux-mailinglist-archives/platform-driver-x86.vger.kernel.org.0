That can still cause issues for dual-mode (i2c + ps2) touchpads which
initially get probed in ps2 mode and then switched over to i2c mode later.

Often this switching over needs to be redone at resume time too,
so for this to work we really need the ps2 aux port to fully work.

I do agree using a platform filter would be somewhat cleaner, but
what we have now has been in use for a long time now without issues,
so I'm in favor of an if it aint broken don't fix approach here.

That is on devices where we need to actually do something to disable
ps2 aux traffic, lets keep the current approach. While try to just not
mess with the i8042 controller *at all* on other devices.

Regards,

Hans
