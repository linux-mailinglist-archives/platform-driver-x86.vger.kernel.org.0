proart-x670e-dmi.patch

hi denis,

i've tested patch for 6.1.8
(https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3D204807#c290) against gentoo =
6.1.12
kernel on ProArt X670E-CREATOR WIFI. seems to work ok.

i attached a patch to put this board in asus_wmi_info_table, as this also
appears to make the module load automatically with a modalias. for the mute=
x, i
checked my DSDT and acpi_board_SBRG_MUTEX seems to exist there, but i am ve=
ry
much a novice in kernel programming so i am unsure if this is correct. if it
helps i can attach my DSDT for this board.

i would very much like for this to be included in a future kernel, so if i =
can
help further let me know.

here is my sensor reading.
