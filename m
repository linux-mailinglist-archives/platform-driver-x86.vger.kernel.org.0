Hi, Hans, thanks for the great advice! I'm excited to see it's already
so close to being done. I have compiled Gergo's module separately from
the kernel tree and loaded it on my laptop and it works perfectly.

I will follow the review comments on the patch, getting it integrated
with the existing module etc. I will also make sure to sign the
commits as you advise. It will be good to have it working for
everyone. This will be my first kernel patch; I have found the docs
page on submitting a patch but let me know if there's anything I'm
missing when I do it.

- Andrew
