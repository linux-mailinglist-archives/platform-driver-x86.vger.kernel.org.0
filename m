So it is supposed to not regress it now, correct?

The driver should also not late-initialize anything.

Windows doesn't do it and the official asus application
can freely send LEDs changing commands to either WMI or USB
so I don't see any reason to do things differently [than windows]
and not prepare every USB endpoint to receive commands,
this has not been addressed unless I confused v7 and v8?

The part we are talking about depends on this driver (hid-asus)
and there are people on asus-linux community using inputplumber
for non-ally devices (the OOT driver is only for ally devices)
therefore it is very important to us (and various other distributions)
not to break that software in any way.

Weighting pros and cons of changing the name I am not sure
changing name brings any benefit? Or am I missing something here?
It's simply used by userspace so the hardware should be loading
regardless of the name...

Along with IP and your tool and asusctl there is also openrgb,
and a newborn application for asus devices (I don't have contacts
with that dev nor I remember the name of the tool)
and I am not even that sure these are all asus-related
applications.

Excercise EXTRA care touching this area as these are enough changes
to make it difficult to understand what exactly is the problem if
someone shows up with LEDs malfunctioning, laptop not entering sleep
anymore or something else entirely. Plus over time
ASUS has used various workarounds for windows problems
and I am not eager to find out what those are since there is only
a realistic way it's going to happen....

Yes once ASUS introduces something new it sticks with that for
future models so it's expected more and more laptops will have
the same problem: I am not questioning if these patches are needed
as they very clearly are; I am questioning if everything that these
patches are doing are worth doing and aren't breaking/regressing
either tools or the flow of actions between the EC and these USB devices.
