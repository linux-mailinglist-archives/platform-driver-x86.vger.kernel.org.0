Hi


I am not sure if this will be useful but I have a Lenovo YOGA 520-14IKB. An=
d on that
machine the hinge rotation angle seems to be reported via a custom HID sens=
or based
on reverse engineering and experimentation.

You might want to check under /sys/bus/platform/drivers/hid_sensor_custom/.=
 In my
case there is one.

$ pwd
/sys/bus/platform/drivers/hid_sensor_custom/HID-SENSOR-2000e1.3.auto
$ cat feature-b-200306/feature-b-200306-value
76 0 101 0 110 0 111 0 118 0 111 0 32 0 89 0 111 0 103 0 97 0

The above feature (property-sensor-model) spells out "Lenovo Yoga" in UTF-1=
6.
As far as I remember this is how the windows service finds the correct sens=
or.
Under the various inputs, the sensor seems to report the hinge rotation ang=
le,
as well as the angles between the keyboard and screen, and the ground level=
.

If the situation is similar in your case, then there is already infrastruct=
ure
to expose the angles to user space in iio sensors. See hid-sensor-custom an=
d
hid-sensor-custom-intel-hinge.
