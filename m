But you can interpret a u8 as a boolean as well was my point.  If it's 0 
it's false, if it's anything else it's true.

But I'm not gonna die on this hill, just wanted to point it out.

Having spent enough time looking at sleep problems I would never make a 
statement like that.  I try really hard to stay on on top of it, but the 
reality is regressions happen all the time.

The other thing to keep in mind is that regressions can happen in 
firmware too, and this is why I generally feel it's best to be 
conservative around sleep states in this area.

I would never tell someone to do it, but technically you can unbind the 
lps0 device.  If this happens what happens to this fan curve stuff? 
Userspace will be frozen and the hardware won't got to a hardware sleep 
state.
