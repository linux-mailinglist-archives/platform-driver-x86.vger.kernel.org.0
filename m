Because we don't know the actual requirements yet. This is a very
young technology and still evolving fast. Also whether we like it
or not, we don't get to dictate what the involved firmware and
hardware interfaces get to look like. So any API which we come
up with must be capable of working with the existing fw and
hw interfaces as shipped in actual devices.

<sigh> we are in no place to make demands here "standard" (non
chrome-os / android) Linux laptop-os usage is a tiny fraction of the
market. So new features like this are primarily developed on other OS-es
and typically we either take the firmware interfaces as is, or we don't
support the feature.

You seem to believe in an utopia where we fully control all the layers
and can design and implement everything to be just perfect, but the
reality is quite different from this.

You also seem to forget that perfect is the enemy of good. This case is
an excellent example of a case where we cannot design anything close to
the "perfect" API in one go because we don't have the necessary
problem-domain information / experience yet.

Yes you've made your opinion on this abundantly clear and I must say
that the whole tone of your emails in this thread and the
"I know better then everyone else" attitude in this thread seriously
rubs me the wrong way.

Don't be surprised if I do not answer any further emails from you in
this thread. That won't be because I don't read them, but that will be
because I deliberately choose to not answer them because IMHO your
strong opinion on how everyone must bow to your vision of how exactly
this all must be implemented adds very little of value to this thread.

Regards,

Hans
