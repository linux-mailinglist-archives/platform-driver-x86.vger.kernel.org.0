On the exact same device, but with a 4500U as of 5.14.11, I do get
accelerometer data.=20

The issues with sensors however is that I do not have an event for the lid =
flip
on this device in order to disable automatically keyboard and trackpad in
tablet mode and no way to use an apparently present ALS for automatic
brightness (I'm not sure even if this device has one, but I've seen quite a=
 lot
of reference to a Capella Micro cm32181 in the DSDT under i2c, and the kern=
el
even load the mentioned driver. No iio data anywhere, though).=20

If the position of the hinges are derived from two accelerometers (one in t=
he
base, the other in the display) I would like to write an implementation aro=
und
that, but the sensor reports only the one in the display panel and nothing
else, so that's really not useful anyway.

However at least I can use display rotation with that.

I really hope that AMD will provide documentation around that or at least w=
ill
properly support his sensor hub to Ryzen 4/5 devices themselves.
