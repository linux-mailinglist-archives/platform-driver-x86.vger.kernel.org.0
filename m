Ok.

If there are 2 interfaces then yes it can get messy, but having 2 interfaces is
exactly what I'm trying to avoid here.

Documenting the flow could be part of the documentation for the
different passwd types. For how things currently work the User and
Admin password attributed would have a type of "password", the hash
example you gave will have a different type for its password attribute,
e.g. "hotp" and not only the type could be different but also
the sysfs-attributes, e.g. the "Admin" password-dir which has a "type"
sysfs-atrribute which returns "htop" may not have a current_password
attribute at all, instead it may would have a hash attribute, making
it (more) clear that this one works differently.

This would mean that existing userspace software can not work with
systems using the new "hotp" password atrributes, but that is
unavoidable.

I think that the current generic password flow will work well
for other vendors too, they may need to not cache it in the
kernel (instead sending it directly to the firmware once), but the basic
concept of having to write the plain-text bios Admin password before
being able to change protected settings seems like it is something which
matches how most current BIOS-es work.  And needing a way to re-lock the
settings also sounds like something which will be pretty common for most
implementations.

We have tried that before in several cases (that I'm aware of) and this never
works out. Esp. not when the basic kernel interface is reasonable sane,
then a lot of people / projects avoid the lib and just poke the kernel API
directly. We have seen this e.g. with hwmon-class devices and with v4l devices
and with backlight-class devices. Since I've seen this happen 3 times already
I'm not a big believer in adding a userspace library to hide the vendor
differences.

Hans
