Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-hwmon says

   Integer value in powers of two (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128).

I think we have some minor deviation here, other than that it makes
sense to me.

Perhaps it's acceptable as long as we mention this in our
documentation?

Thanks for your detailed information. I'll stick with fanY_target,
remove fanY_enable, and mention 0 =3D> auto mode in the documentation.
