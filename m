I know all this by now, but we're discussion here is whether kernel should 
do "special handling". Although, it's not really correct to depict 
representing 64-bit counter in its entirety as "special handling".

I think the kernel should combine the 64-bit halved and you argumented 
it shouldn't. When I went to confirm the claim your argument was based 
on, I couldn't find on what basis the claim was made.

This does nothing to answer my question. Where in the kernel, there's an 
example where a 64-bit counter for BlueField platform is presented as 2 
32-bit counters? If there isn't any examples in the kernel, your statement 
about consistency within the platform doesn't hold water, quoted (again) 
here for clarity what I'm refering to:

"The other interfaces follow this approach of having lower and upper 
32-bits separately in each counter, and the tools expect the same.
Hence the driver follows this approach to keep things consistent across 
the BlueField platform."

Where I can find those "other interfaces" that already follow this 
convention?
