Dear friend,

Greetings to you and your family, Kindly pay attention to my aim of
contacting you. My name is Mrs. Elodie Sia, and I work with the United
Bank for Africa (UBA), I am the manager of bill and exchange in THE
BANK.

I need your urgent assistance in transferring the sum of $5.500.000usd
(Five Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) into your
existing or a new bank account.

Be rest assured that everything will be handled confidentially. Six
years ago, most of the greedy African Politicians used our bank to
launder money overseas through their political advisers' help. Most of
the funds they transferred out of Africa's shores were gold and oil
money that was supposed to have been used to develop the continent. As
I am sending this message to you, I could divert Five Million Dollars
($5.5M), which is in an escrow transit account belonging to no one in
the bank, now my bank is very anxious to know the real beneficiary of
the funds.

I was hoping you could apply to our bank as the sole beneficiary of
this fund to enable our bank to approve this fund in your favor and
transfer it into your bank account. Be rest assured that everything
will be handled confidentially.

When the fund has been transferred into your bank account, I will come
to your country to share the fund. The fund will be shared 50% for me
and 40% for you, and the other 10% for the orphanages home and poor
with less-privilege people.

I want us to do this business based on trust for the benefit of both
our families.

I await your response.

Thanks for your Cooperation
Mrs. Elodie Sia
bill and exchange Manager
United Bank For Africa
