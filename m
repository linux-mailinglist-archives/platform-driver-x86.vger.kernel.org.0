Huh?!
You simply have the wrong assumption (see (1) and (2) above) and
_this_ is my point. And it seems you still can't admit that. Be brave!

Same question to you.

See just above. I don't like when people are blind with their
brilliant solutions.

Of course documentation exists. Otherwise it wouldn't be possible to
program or do something about the chips.

Exactly my (another) point!

If you can do that...

Bottom line, the proposed solution can't be accepted because it
appeals to the false assumptions besides other technical issues which
have been pointed out by the others.
