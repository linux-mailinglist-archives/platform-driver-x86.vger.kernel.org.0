Like I said elsewhere it seems a lot easier to just have the I2C driver
set platform data based on parsing DMI information like we do elsewhere.
I really don't see any benefit to introducing an additional layer of
abstraction and binding here, it just seems to be making things more
fragile.

I'm not sure what you mean by "register the platform devices for the
regualtor to bind to" - if the PMIC is an I2C device it's going to need
to be an I2C device, and if the device is enumerated by firmware we'd
need to suppress that firmware enumeration to replace it.
