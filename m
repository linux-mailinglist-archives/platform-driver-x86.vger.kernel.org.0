Let's also remember that we have to handle not just regulators, but also
GPIOs and clocks. And I'm pretty sure there will be more. We could have
a mechanism specific to the tps68470 driver to pass platform data from
the board file to the driver, and replicate that mechanism in different
drivers (for other regulators, clocks and GPIOs), but I really would
like to avoid splitting the DMI-conditioned platform data in those
drivers directly. I'd like to store all the init data for a given
platform in a single "board" file.
