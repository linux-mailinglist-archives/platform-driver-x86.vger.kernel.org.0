I agree generally, though there are some limitations. As Armin mentioned, t=
he
firmware-attributes interface will handle this with the pattern
/sys/class/firmware-attributes/<name>. <name> is derived when the class is
initialized. In v1 I used lenovo-legion-wmi but based on the discussion so =
far
I'll likely drop legion from all patterns and call everything based on its =
GUID
plain text name like Mark suggested, lenovo-wmi-other for Other Method,
lenovo-wmi-custom for Custom Method, etc. That will ensure two things:
(1) drivers won't conflict in namespace if there is an unused but present i=
n
the bios older interface on a newer device.
(2) Userspace apps can determine the preferred interface for a given device=
 if
more than one happens to be present. I don't think this will be very common=
,
but it can be handled if it does happen.

The goal of this driver, jointly with asus-armoury, is to standardize the
features that aren't already in the kernel while utilizing those that are. =
I.E.
AMD PPT doesn't yet have a standard interface, platform-profile does. The n=
ames
of the attributes that provide specific functionality will remain the same
between drivers (ppt_pl1_spl for example). As firmware-attributes is a clas=
s,
it is easy to use udev in userspace apps to avoid hard coding paths so that=
 any
interface that provides these attributes will be interchangeable or include=
 a
hierarchy table. In the event more than one "competing" driver loads the
userspace app can prioritize a specific interface and, if a genuine conflic=
t
arises between two drivers on a specific device, it will be easy enough to
quirk that device to not load one or the other. The fanfullspeed attribute
should be able to follow this same pattern when implemented.

Since each driver will be independent I don't see this being a problem.
lenovo-acpi-tunables or lenovo-i2c-tunables (as example) could coexist.
As above, each firmware-attributes path will be different but the attribute=
s
within them would be standardized.

I think that is the consensus going forward. In v2 each interface will be
independent of the others except when it relies on a WMI data block as part=
 of
its data validation.

Generally I prefer to use the path of least intervention and automatic
discovery with explicit deny lists, then explicit allow lists if needed. Th=
at
will limit the amount of work needed to support new hardware that implement=
s
the same functionality. WMI interfaces for example should load automaticall=
y,
unless there is a restrictive DMI quirk for a specific model. If BIOS revis=
ion
is of concern then that driver will quirk an alternative method or deny the
driver overall. If automatic discovery isn't an option, such as EC writes w=
ith
inb/outb, then we would explicitly load it using a DMI table in that driver=
.
From my experience this seems to be the standard for kernel drivers. We wil=
l
need to rely on your historical data and Lenovo to get this right.
