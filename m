I agree.

For ACPI / WMI / EC drivers it will pretty much always be about the device's
internal camera.

I would only expect "disable all cameras (like some sort of configuration
shortcut)" to be seen on some external keyboards, not on laptop builtin
keyboards.

On some of the laptops they camera on/off hotkey even has a little LED in
there to indicate when the camera is turned off just like the mute LED
sometimes found in mic / speaker mute hotkeys.

Hans
