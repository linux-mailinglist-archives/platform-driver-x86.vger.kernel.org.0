So if i8042.noaux does not do anything, then why do you want to add
"SYNA2B33" to the list of ACPI HIDs for which we set:

features.touchpad_ctrl_via_ec=0;

?

IOW what bad effects / behavior are you seeing with touchpad_ctrl_via_ec=1?

Or are you seeing bad behavior on some other modes? If yes, then what
is the bad behavior you are seeing on other models ?

Ok, VPCCMD_W_TOUCHPAD with a value of 1 not being harmful
matches with current the ideapad-laptop code which actually does
this when features.touchpad_ctrl_via_ec == 0:

       if (!priv->features.touchpad_ctrl_via_ec)
                write_ec_cmd(priv->adev->handle, VPCCMD_W_TOUCHPAD, 1);

I think that before trying to come up with a solution here,
we first need to identify what part of the code enabled by
touchpad_ctrl_via_ec == 1 is actually causing issues for people.

Unfortunately non of the commit messages of the commits adding
touchpad_ctrl_via_ec=0 quirks actually properly describe the
unwanted behavior users are seeing with touchpad_ctrl_via_ec=1

I'm guessing that this part:

                unsigned char param;
                /*
                 * Some IdeaPads don't really turn off touchpad - they only
                 * switch the LED state. We (de)activate KBC AUX port to turn
                 * touchpad off and on. We send KEY_TOUCHPAD_OFF and
                 * KEY_TOUCHPAD_ON to not to get out of sync with LED
                 */
                i8042_command(&param, value ? I8042_CMD_AUX_ENABLE : I8042_CMD_AUX_DISABLE);

May cause issues on some models. It definitely feels fishy and
I would like to disable this except on models where:

1. There is a LED controlled by some touchpad on/off hotkey; and
2. The EC fails to disable the touchpad itself

Which would currently mean only enable this bit on Maxim's Z570
using a DMI based allow list.

###

I know from experience that this part:

                ideapad_input_report(priv, value ? 67 : 66);

Also is a bit troublesome on some models causing spurious touchpad
on/off OSD notifications after suspend/resume.

I'm not sure what to do there. If the touchpad gets disabled
in hw by the EC itself then sending KEY_TOUCHPAD_TOGGLE seems
wrong, especially since then the userspace touchpad state and
the EC touchpad state can get out of sync...

Ok, so that idea is a no go then, thanks for testing.

At least on Maxim's Z570 the laptop does toggle the value
returned by VPCCMD_R_TOUCHPAD and the LED it self, while at the
same time not actually disabling the touchpad.

The problem is this all relies on being able to detect i2c vs ps/2
touchpads which is not as simple as it sounds. Specifically many
new touchpad are connected to both busses at the same time, offering
a ps/2 mode by default for compatibility with older software / os-es
and being able to switch to a modern i2c/smbus mode for better performance.

I've asked Benjamin Tissoires, the kernel expert on this about this
and his answer was that it is almost impossible to determine if
a touchpad is going to be using ps/2 or i2c without first waiting
for the whole driver stack to have initialized and then see which
driver(s) are attached and I guess even then the touchpad might
show up as both ps/2 + i2c with only one of them actually generating
events:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-input/ae50236e-1ce8-b526-9c17-7bc0463ebb86@redhat.com/T/#u

So based on Benjamin's answer I'm afraid that trying to differentiate
between i2c vs ps2 is not really doable.

###

An alternative proposal for a fix for this
==========================================

0: identify the currently troublesome behavior
---------------------------------------------------

As mentioned above I believe there are 2 potentially
troublesome things done one newer laptops when
touchpad_ctrl_via_ec == 1:

1. i8042_command(&param, value ? I8042_CMD_AUX_ENABLE : I8042_CMD_AUX_DISABLE)
2. Sending of wrong/spurious KEY_TOUCHPAD_OFF / KEY_TOUCHPAD_ON events.

1: Fixing undesirable i8042_command(... I8042_CMD_AUX_DISABLE) calls
--------------------------------------------------------------------

My suggestion is to move to an allow-list for this and for now
populate that list with only the DMI strings for Maxim's Z570 and see
from there.

2: Fixing wrong/spurious KEY_TOUCHPAD_OFF / KEY_TOUCHPAD_ON events
------------------------------------------------------------------

There are 2 subcases here:

2.1: Fix sending of KEY_TOUCHPAD_OFF/_ON events at probe/resume
---------------------------------------------------------------

We can simply fix this by giving ideapad_sync_touchpad_state()
a parameter to let it know if events should be send at all and
set that parameter to false when called on probe/resume

2.2: Sending wrong KEY_TOUCHPAD_OFF/_ON events at toggle time
-------------------------------------------------------------

On models where the EC does not control the touchpad at all,
currently we still do ideapad_sync_touchpad_state() and then
send either KEY_TOUCHPAD_OFF or _ON based on the value read
from VPCCMD_R_TOUCHPAD.

But on these models VPCCMD_R_TOUCHPAD always returns 0 or 1,
so we always send KEY_TOUCHPAD_OFF or always send KEY_TOUCHPAD_ON,
instead of toggling the state / asking userspace to toggle
its sw touchpad on/off state.

I believe we can detect this case by checking that
the value read from VPCCMD_R_TOUCHPAD has not changed
despite us receiving a notify with bit 5 being set in
the value read from VPCCMD_R_VPC1.

My suggestion to fix this case is to detect when the value
read from VPCCMD_R_TOUCHPAD does not change and in that
case send KEY_TOUCHPAD_TOGGLE to userspace.

Regards,

Hans
