Hi Luke,
good luck to your future endeavors.

The OOT reference was not to disparage the drivers, just to note that
in kernels that use those, hid-asus is stubbed for the Ally so there
is no change there.

As for reasons, see below.

> - "Matches updated product branding"

Reason for [1]

> - "Aligning with USB-IF device class names"

Reason for the change in this patch

If you would like me to stop cc'ing you in future asus changes let me
know. I am preparing some additional patches for the Duo class of
laptops.

Best,
Antheas
