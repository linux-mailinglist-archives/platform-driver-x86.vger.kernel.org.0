Ok, so if I understand this correctly, then if both a bios-admin and
a system-mgmt password are set then with the bios-admin option
all options accept those on the "security settings" BIOS screen
can be changed, and with the system-mgmt password everything can
be changed, is that correct?

Also can you update the new text here to try and explain this
somewhat ?

I understand, so like a master-key vs a normal key in a big office building.

Can you update the new text here to try and explain this somewhat ?

Great.
