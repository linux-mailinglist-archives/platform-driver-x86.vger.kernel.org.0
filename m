Subject: [PATCH 00/24] platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Refactor hotkey handling and add support for some new hotkeys

Hi All,

My reply in the "[PATCH v2 1/4] platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi:
simplify known_ev handling" handling where I indicated that I would work
on converting the thinkpad_acpi hotkey handling to use sparse-keymaps
underestimated the work this required quite a bit.

The hotkey code is quite old and crufty and full of special cases to
support many generations of ThinkPads, so I ended up doing some
significant refactoring and cleanup before doing the actual conversion
to sparse-keymaps.

I have been vary careful to not introduce any changes wrt support for
the original ThinkPad models / hotkeys which use the hotkey_*_mask
related code.

I've also done my best to avoid any *significant* functional change but
there are still some functional changes, which should all not impact
userspace compatibility:

1. Adaptive keyboard special keys will now also send EV_MSC events with
   the scancode, just like all the other hotkeys.

2. Rely on the input core for KEY_RESERVED suppression. This means that
   keys marked as KEY_RESERVED will still send EV_MSC evdev events when
   pressed (which helps users with mapping them to non reserved KEY_FOO
   values if desired).

3. Align the keycodes for volume up/down/mute and brightness up/down with
   those set by userspace through udev upstream's hwdb. Note these are all
   for keys which are suppressed by hotkey_reserved_mask by default.
   So this is only a functional change for users who override the default
   hotkey-mask *and* who do not have udev's default hwdb installed.

4. Suppress ACPI netlink event generation for unknown 0x1xxx hkey events to
   avoid userspace starting to rely on the netlink events for new hotkeys
   before these have been added to the keymap, only to have the netlink
   events get disabled by the adding of the new hotkeys to the keymap.

   This should not cause a behavior change for existing models since all
   currently known 0x1xxx events have a mapping.

Here is a quick breakdown of the patches in this series:

Patch 1 - 2: Fix a small locking issue on rmmod the only problem here
   really is a lockdep warning, so I plan to route these fixes through
   for-next together with the rest to keep things simple.

Patch 3 - 14: Do a bunch of cleanups and refactoring

Patch 15: Implements functional change no 4. I really kinda want to just
   completely disable ACPI netlink event generation when also sending evdev
   events instead of reporting these twice. But for the 0x11xx / 0x13xx
   hkey events the kernel has send ACPI netlink events for years now. So
   this disables ACPI netlink events for any new hotkeys going forward.

Patch 16 - 18: Refactor / cleanup reserved key handling

Patch 19: Actually move to sparse-keymaps

Patch 20: Update the keymap for 2 adaptive kbd Fn row keys

Patch 21 - 24: Mark's original patches adding support for the new Fn + N
   key combo and for trackpoint doubletap slightly reworked to use
   the new sparse-keymap.

Mark if you can make some time to review patches 1-20 that would be great.

Regards,

Hans
