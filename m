I'll try to run some tests.
Just to get this right:
Is the usleep_range() patch about helping with the buggy interrupts?

Or is is about further lowering the power consumption below 2 % per hour?
(2 % per hour is the best I got until now, when the deepest state was active
all the time)

All tests where made with BIOS version 01.10.00 Rev.A (released 2022-08-09 /
build 2022-07-13)
This is the most recent BIOS version available.

  AMD GOP EFI Driver AMD GOP X64 Release Driver, version 2.16.0.17.10
  Cypress Power Delivery (PD) Firmware, version 0.7.0

I got no Windows installed. But I'm wondering how Windows is handling this
firmware bug?

Does "certified with Ubuntu" mean HP is officially supporting it?
Or does this mean, that just Ubuntu says it's working?

I can try posting the HP support for HP support forum or calling the HP
business support hotline. But most of the it's quite hard to get real help =
from
them.

Wouldn't it be better, if you - as official AMD employee - report this to H=
P!?

EC means "Embedded Controller"?
GPE means "General Purpose Event"?

Maybe I can more explicitly test if it's the battery level.
Removing the battery is possible. It's just a little more effort.
But instead I could fully charge the battery and put the notebook into s2id=
le
with AC power connected. In that case the battery level shouldn't change. S=
o no
event should happen, if I DON'T I press the keyboard, (un)plug the ac power=
 or
open/close the lid.


I attached another log:

System was in s2idle for 30 minutes without interruption (deepest state the
whole time). System was on battery power (no ac power connected). And comme=
nt
#25 (including comment #14) patches where applied. I just opened and closed=
 the
lid 30 seconds before waking the system using the power button. So the syst=
em
wasn't in deepest state of sleep.

A little more than 1 % of battery was consumed. And I'm wondering if this m=
ight
contradicts your theory, about the EC trying to notify about a new battery
level.

I'm a late riser person. And I also like my notebook to stay asleep, unless=
 I
press the power button ;-)

So I'll go to bed now. And I'll also put the notebook on battery (no ac pow=
er
connected) and into s2idle with the ec_no_wakeup workaround enabled. So
tomorrow morning I'll see how much power it has consumed using the ec_no_wa=
keup
workaround :-)
