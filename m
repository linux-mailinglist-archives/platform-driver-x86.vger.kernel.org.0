So I've been thinking more about this and to me this whole argument
sounds a lot like we just want to have our own little corner to
play in, without needing to worry about what other vendors do.

And then Lenovo, and HP and who knows else will all want the same
and we and up with at least 5 different interfaces.

It is bad enough that we already have to deal with having 5+
different firmware interfaces for this and worse even for silly
things like setting the brightness level for the kbd backlight,
which is such a trivial thing that you would think PC vendors
should be able to sit down and agree on a single ACPI API for it.

We are NOT going to take this lets all do our own thing approach and
also let this trickle up in the stack to the kernel <-> userspace API!

One of the tasks of the kernel is to act as a HAL and this clearly
falls under that. Imagine if userspace code would need to use different
kernel APIs for storage/filesystem accesses depending on if they were
running on a Dell or a Lenovo machines. Or having different APIs to
access the network depending on the machine vendor...

So I'm sorry, but I'm drawing a line in the sand here, unless you can
come up with some really convincing NEW arguments why this needs to
be a Dell specific interface, the Dell firmware-attributes code must
use a generic sysfs-ABI/class to get accepted upstream.

Note that I think the currently suggested private Dell ABI is actually
pretty suitable for such a generic sysfs-ABI/class, so I'm not asking
you to make a lot of changes here.

Regards,

Hans
