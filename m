The patch which is being worked on here is simply changing the method of
accessing hardware, it does _not_ change the underlying driver which deciph=
ers
the sensor inputs.=20

To improve the output you've got to create e.g. /etc/sensors.d/nct6798.conf=
 and
describe your desired configuration there but that's outside the scope of t=
his
bugzilla. Please read lm-sensors documentations for that.

I've already done that for the ASUS TUF GAMING X570-PLUS (WI-FI) motherboar=
d:
https://github.com/lm-sensors/lm-sensors/pull/216 but my configuration is v=
ery
incomplete since the documentation for this chip is likely proprietary and =
not
available publicly. Even HWiNFO64 fails to decipher multiple inputs and sho=
ws
them as is and that's the best application for that under Windows. Then cer=
tain
inputs may simply not be connected to anything and basically report white
noise.

If you have close contacts at ASUS they may give you the data but that's far
from certain. For some reasons hardware monitoring for motherboards, GPUs a=
nd
CPUs is veiled in secrecy and protected by patents and NDA.
