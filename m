Yes if you can do that, then that would be great.

The end result should really be a patch-series then with the first patch
being the prep patch introducing a new ideapad-laptop.h I suggested
during my review. This patch can have you as the author + your
Signed-off-by.

The 2nd patch would then introduce a new version of Gergo's driver using
the helper functions introduced in the first patch.

For this patch you want to keep Gergo as the author (1), and then add
yourself as co-author by using the following tags at the end of
the commit message:

Co-developed-by: Andrew Kallmeyer <kallmeyeras@gmail.com>
Signed-off-by: Andrew Kallmeyer <kallmeyeras@gmail.com>

Note do NOT add a Signed-off-by for Gergo, he clearly intended to
submit his code under the GPL (see the GPL copyright header in
the new file) so the Signed-off-by missing is fine. And you must
not add Signed-off-by-s for other people. A S-o-b must always
be given by the person themselves.

Regards,

Hans
