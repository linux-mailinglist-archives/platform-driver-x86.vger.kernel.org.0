It was just because I didn't want to have a not working "touchpad"
attribute :) I used/still using several GNOME extensions and they show
me "Touchpad" toggle just because I have "touchpad" attribute exposed
there, which is doing nothing, and misleading.

But I would understand if you don't want to touch it at that stage, and
you would rather prefer not working "touchpad" attributes to not
exposed "touchpad" attributes that would have been perfectly working.

Agreed, but do you mean "and" or "or"? I mean we can also include the
models that toggle touchpad value while not really toggling the touchpad
(just as you described below) and don't have a touchpad LED (but I don't
know if such model exists really), this way they won't go out of sync
regardless of is there a touchpad LED or not.

Thanks for the explanation and the link, but as Benjamin said, I believe
we can use ACPI table for detecting PS/2 devices. I believe the DSDTs
with PS2M(and probably MSS[0-9] too) devices probably have PS/2 touchpad,
and have working EC and i8042 commands. Yet this still needs
confirmation/testing, and I think should be resorted if your suggestion
below won't work - your suggestion looks better and easier.

Agreed.

Agreed.

While this is an awesome idea, what about doing this at boot?
Like we will send 0 first, then check if it reads 0, then send 1,
and confirm if it reads 1. This would be the ultimate solution, and
would also fix my "cosmetic" concerns :)

Best,
Eray
