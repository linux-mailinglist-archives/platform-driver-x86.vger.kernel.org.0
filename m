Ah I did not realize that. Ok that sounds good to me.

I'll go and apply the patch then. To be on the save side I'm going
to only add this to -next, so that it gets some testing before
showing up in stable series. Once 6.4-rc1 is out you can then
send it to stable@vger.kernel.org to get it backported.

I assume that on some older models there is no standard ACPI EC device
in the ACPI tables, so there only ECRD/ECWR work. I guess that code-paths
which directly call ec_read() / ec_write() are only used on newer
models. But this does indeed seem inconsistent.

Mark Pearson from Lenovo can hopefully help answer this, but I know
that he is quite busy atm. Hopefully Mark will get back to you when
he has some more bandwidth.
