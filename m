Why not just do what things like rt5670 do and have the driver probe
for the PMIC use DMI information to set up platform data?  That seems a
lot more straightforward.

So long as people keep building systems that don't fit the ACPI model
using ACPI, and indeed with no firmware description at all for important
bits of the system, it's just a question of which particular kind of
mess we end up with cleaning up after them.  These vendors really should
adopt a standards based approach rather than relying on these DMI hacks.
