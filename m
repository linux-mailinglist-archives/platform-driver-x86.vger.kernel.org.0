Yes we do.

It would be a little bit harder for 3rd parties wanting to implement the hwmon 
interface then and i'm also thinking of implementing it in the thermal subsystem 
(albeit i did not do a proper readup on that system yet so maybe it wont work).

Knock on wood that the generic acpi interface works out ^^.
