Hi Hans, thank you so much for taking the time to read through the
questions and get back to me!

This is actually exactly what I have already implemented with the one
exception: I am executing exactly the same kind of logic you mentioned
(via schedule_work()) but I have NOT filtered out the keypress;
instead, it is just scheduling this logic to run in a workqueue and
then going ahead and passing along the keypress as well, just in case
anyone wanted to trigger any other kind of event from this hotkey.

I have actually submitted a patch to the keyboard hwdb which was
merged in to systemd that maps this particular key to "unknown" with
the idea that someone who has this model would also likely have this
platform driver module loaded, so by default the kernel-space action
to actually change the brightness level would be executed (the
"EC-like" behavior as you mentioned that they could not change), but
the user would also have the option of remapping the key and
triggering additional actions on top of this if they wanted.  Does
that sound appropriate or is it better to just filter out the keypress
entirely once the above actions are scheduled/executed?

Also as an aside, I have had a few users who have mentioned that if
they have compiled and loaded i8042 as a module (which is then marked
as "used by" samsung_galaxybook due to the i8042 filter), if they
execute a modprobe -r then it also removes i8042 and their keyboard
stops working. Is this known/expected behavior and/or is there
anything that can be done in this driver itself to try and help
prevent this from happening? Otherwise I guess a "fix" for this would
be if users compile their kernel with CONFIG_SERIO_I8042=y then they
would not have this problem?

Thank you again!

Best regards,
Joshua
