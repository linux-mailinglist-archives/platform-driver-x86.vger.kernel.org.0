That is an abuse of platform devices, as that is not what they are for.

Please do so.

A PCIe device is a virtual thing, what HW cost do they have?

Anyway, a platform device should NOT ever be a child of a PCI device,
that is not ok and should be fixed here please.

A platform device is just that, something that the platform provides on
a non-discoverable bus.  A PCIe device is NOT that type of device at
all and never has been.
