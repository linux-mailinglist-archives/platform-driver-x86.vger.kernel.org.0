This absolutely needs to be part of the commit log and the patch.

If the device advertises PME_Support for D3hot or D3cold, but we don't
actually get those PMEs after putting it in D3hot or D3cold, that's a
bug in the device.  "AMD's platform can't handle devices waking from
hardware sleep" isn't specific enough to help future PCI maintenance
because "hardware sleep state" is not a PCI concept.

So it sounds like either of these scenarios would work:

  A) Root Port stays in D0, PMC selects platform state X, wakeups still
     work

  B) Root Port in D3hot, PMC selects platform state Y that doesn't
     break wakeups, so wakeups still work

PCI isn't in a position to pick one over the other because it has no
idea what the tradeoffs are.

IIUC, this quirk basically forces scenario A (although a naive reading
would suggest that we could still put the Root Port in D1 or D2, since
the quirk only mentions D3).

If true, this seems important, not something to discard because it's
after "---".

Why did you pick dev_flags?  If there's not a reason to prefer that,
I'd just add a 1-bit bitfield because that doesn't require a new
#define.

I want to know whether this is D3hot, D3cold, or both.  Also in the
pci_info() below.

Also, do we have some indication that this is specific to Ryzen?  If
not, I assume this is an ongoing issue, and matching on Device IDs
just means we'll have to debug the same problem again and add more
IDs.

I don't remember seeing any evidence that this is a USB4-specific
issue.  My guess is that it affects wakeups from *any* device below
these Root Ports, since I assume the PMEs are bog standard PCIe
events, not anything special about USB4.

It sounds like this is only an issue when amd_pmc_s2idle_prepare() is
involved, right?  The PMEs and wakeups work as expected until we tell
the PMC to do its magic thing?

If so, shouldn't this be conditional on something in amd/pmc.c to
connect these pieces together?  Looks like amd/pmc.c only works if
the platform provides an AMDI0005, AMDI0006, etc., ACPI device?

I think it'd be nice if amd_pmc_probe() logged a hint about it being
activated.  AFAICS it only logs something on errors.  This has been
incredibly painful to debug.  It looks like the PMCs do very subtle
power management things, and it'd be nice to have a hint that there's
really fancy stuff going on in the background.
