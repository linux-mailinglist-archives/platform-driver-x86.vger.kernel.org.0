That is actually a pretty good idea, the LED subsystem has the notion
of triggers, which are identified simply with a string.

So we could simple add a LED class device which sets it default trigger
to "camera-front" and then have either the sensor-drivers start-stream
or maybe even something more generic, so in the media subsystem code
somewhere set the led trigger.

See e.g. the LED class device in drivers/hid/hid-lenovo.c and how
it sets data->led_micmute.default_trigger = "audio-micmute",
combined with the drivers/leds/trigger/ledtrig-audio.c code,
where the ALSA kernel code just does, e.g.:

ledtrig_audio_set(LED_AUDIO_MUTE, 1);
or:
ledtrig_audio_set(LED_AUDIO_MUTE, 0);

We would then probably need to do something like rename
the drivers/leds/trigger/ledtrig-audio.c code and extend the
enum led_audio type with front + back cameras. That or copy the
code, but just renaming it seems better then adding a copy.

And then all need is to have something call:

ledtrig_multimedia_set(LED_CAMERA_FRONT, 0);
ledtrig_multimedia_set(LED_CAMERA_FRONT, 1);

And we are done.

I think the biggest question here is where to put those
ledtrig_multimedia_set() calls ?

These calls will be no-ops when no LED has its trigger
set to "camera-front", so there is no need to worry
about making them conditional (other then them being
conditional (or stubbed out?) when the LED subsystem
is disabled).

Note I would like to move forward with this patch set as is,
to unblock distros wanting to package the out of tree
IPU6 driver for now and then we can convert things to this
model later.

Please let me know if there are any objections with going
with this patch-set as an intermediate solution.

Regards,

Hans
