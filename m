Ah ok, so did get that part right :)

So basically any write to /sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile
will reset the pwm1_enable to "2" if it was not "2" already.

Ok that is fine.

No worries, maybe wait a bit with posting v15 till Bastien has a chance
to way in on this discussion though.

Regards,

Hans
