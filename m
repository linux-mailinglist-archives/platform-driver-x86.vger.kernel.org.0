This patch is now in -next as commit 4c71ae414474
("platform/x86/amd/pmf: Add support SPS PMF feature"), where it causes
the following clang warning:

  drivers/platform/x86/amd/pmf/sps.c:96:2: error: variable 'mode' is used uninitialized whenever switch default is taken [-Werror,-Wsometimes-uninitialized]
          default:
          ^~~~~~~
  drivers/platform/x86/amd/pmf/sps.c:101:9: note: uninitialized use occurs here
          return mode;
                 ^~~~
  drivers/platform/x86/amd/pmf/sps.c:84:9: note: initialize the variable 'mode' to silence this warning
          u8 mode;
                 ^
                  = '\0'
  1 error generated.

As far as I can tell, the default case cannot actually happen due to the
advertising of choices in amd_pmf_init_sps() and the check against those
choices in platform_profile_store() but it would be good to avoid this
warning, especially given that it is fatal with CONFIG_WERROR.

I do not mind sending a patch for this but I am a little unclear what
the best fix would be. Removing the default case would cause -Wswitch
warnings because current_profile is an enum (plus it would make finding
invalid profiles harder if there was ever a change in the core). Perhaps
changing the return type to be an int, returning an error code in the
default case, then updating the call sites to check for an error? I am
open to other suggestions (or if you want to sent a fix yourself, just
consider this a report).

Cheers,
Nathan
