Sorry about that. I included you because there was suggestion from Lee
to convert the MFD driver in patch 37 to use regmap but the registers
are all 64-bit and it was not clear whether regmap supports that:

  https://www.spinics.net/lists/platform-driver-x86/msg20652.html

Looking at the regmap API it seems to deal mostly with "unsigned int"
which does not work well with the 64-bit MMIO registers but I may be
missing something.
