I'm afraid that things are a bit more complicated here. The idea here
is that we have a subsystem outside of the DRM subsystem which received
a hotplug event for a drm-connector.  The only info which this subsystem
has is a reference on the fwnode level (either through device-tree or
to platform-code instantiating software-fwnode-s + links for this).

So in order to deliver the hotplug event to the connector we need
to lookup the connector by fwnode.

I've chosen to implement this by iterating over all drm_class
devices with a dev_type of drm_connector using class_dev_iter_init()
and friends. This makes sure that we either get a reference to
the device, or that we skip the device if it is being deleted.

But this just gives us a reference to the connector->kdev, not
to the connector itself. A pointer to the connector itself is stored
as drvdata inside the device, but without taking a reference as
this patch does, there is no guarantee that that pointer does not
point to possibly free-ed mem.

We could set drvdata to 0 from drm_sysfs_connector_remove()
Before calling device_unregister(connector->kdev) and then do
something like this inside drm_connector_find_by_fwnode():

/*
 * Lock the device to ensure we either see the drvdata == NULL
 * set by drm_sysfs_connector_remove(); or we block the removal
 * from continuing until we are done with the device.
 */
device_lock(dev);
connector = dev_get_drvdata(dev);
if (connector && connector->fwnode == fwnode) {
	drm_connector_get(connector);
	found = connector;
}
device_unlock(dev);

With the device_lock() synchronizing against the device_lock()
in device_unregister(connector->kdev). So that we either see
drvdata == NULL if we race with unregistering; or we get
a reference on the drm_connector obj before its ref-count can
drop to 0.

There might be places though where we call code take the device_lock
while holding a lock necessary for the drm_connector_get() , so
this approach might lead to an AB BA deadlock. As such I think
my original approach is better (also see below).

> Lookup tables holding full references tends to lead to all kinds of bad
> side effects.

The proposed reference is not part of a lookup list, it is a
reference from the kdev on the drm_connector object which gets
dropped as soon as the kdev's refcount hits 0, which normally
happens directly after drm_connector_unregister() has run.

In many other places in the kernel problems like this are
solved by embedding the device struct inside the containing
data struct (so the drm_connector struct) and using the
device_struct's refcounting for all refcounting and using
the device struct's release callback as the release callback for
the entire object.

That is not doable here since the drm_object code has its own
refcounting going on. What this patch is in essence doing is
simulating having only 1 refcount, by making sure the
main-object release callback does not get run until
the drm_objects' refcount and the device's refcount have
both reached 0 (by keeping the drm_object's refcount at
a minimum of 1 as long as there are references to the
device).

Regards,

Hans
