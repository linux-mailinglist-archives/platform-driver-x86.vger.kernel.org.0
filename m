That's much more fwnode than swnode.  fwnode is a cute hack for letting
ACPI based systems that don't fit the ACPI model reuse DT bindings which
can work well for some things which are just outside the scope of ACPI
completely but is a really bad idea for things where there's specific
firmware modelling for the thing being handled, in those cases it should
be avoided and firmware specific handling used instead.  Power handling
(including regulators) is one of those areas - ACPI has really strong
opinions on how it should be done and we don't want to be encouraging
systems to go against that model.  AFAICT swnode is mostly just a way of
patching up firmware that could be getting away with fwnode but didn't
for some reason, in this case we don't want to ever see ACPI systems
trying to use the DT regulator bindings in their firmware descriptions.

Like I said in reply to Andy's mail if we're essentially filling in a C
struct through a massive pile of indirection involving writing C code
containing a bunch of static initialisations of less specific structs
that doesn't seem great.  We can probably arrange to pass the init_data
=66rom different files rather than putting the quirks in the driver,
that'd be fine if a bit more work, but swnodes only seem to be adding
problems here.
