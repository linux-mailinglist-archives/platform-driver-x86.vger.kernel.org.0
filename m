I wasn't sure about debugfs but did consider it. It seemed to be adding 
a whole extra layer. I'm happy to do that if that's what is recommended 
but not having it available with secureboot could be annoying for users.

This feature is mostly used internally (which is fine) but we have had 
occasions where we've used it with customers; and with the WMI interface 
it's usually the enterprise customers who do have secure boot enabled. 
I'd like to avoid that limitation if possible.

Yeah - apologies. It was such a tiny change that I was being lazy.
Thanks you for splitting them out but if you're busy let me know and 
I'll happily clean that myself. I had missed the remove part completely.

Thanks
