--- Comment #43 from Philipp Jungkamp (p.jungkamp@gmx.net) ---
I can report that this also fixes the brightness keys on the 'Lenovo Yoga 9
14IAP7'.

I was just trying to trace the ACPI events on Windows when I found this thr=
ead
while browsing the Mailing list in the train.

My device has multiple of these open app keys (Support, Favorite App, Virtu=
al
Background, Sound Profile, Dark Mode Toggle), I just wrote a short WMI driv=
er
to get them working. Have you figured out how to get these working for
yourself? I presume the open application key you were talking about is the
"star with an S inside", which is also present on my device.
