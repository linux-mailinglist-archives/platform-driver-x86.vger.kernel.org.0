FWIW I agree with the changes which you suggest for the 4th patch.

But do we really want to land these changes, while ATM we do not
really have any need for them ?  Esp. the

"platform/x86: i2c-multi-instantiate: Pass ACPI fwnode to instantiated I2C-clients"

Change is not without a chance of regressions. The acpi_device_is_first_physical_node()
behavior surprised me a bit while working on the BOSC0200 changes. So I'm not
100% sure I have managed to see / think of all implications of this change.

Heikki do you now (or in the near future) need access to the fwnode for
the TypeC controllers handled by the i2c-multi-instantiate code ?

Note that if we do decide to move forward with this set, it should probably
be merged in its entirety by Wolfram as it also makes i2c-core changes
(or Wolfram could just merge the i2c-core change and provide an immutable
branch for me to merge into pdx86/for-next.

And then your (Andy's) cleanup series can be applied on top of this once merged.

Regards,

Hans
