> Compiled with all patches from comment #14, 1) and 2).

OK, I also sent that new idlemask patch I suggested to the mailing list for=
 the
future to make debugging easier.
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/platform-driver-x86/patch/202209292150=
42.745-1-mario.limonciello@amd.com/

I don't have any evidence that the usleep_range() change helped in any way,=
 so
I won't send that for now.

If you discover that is required for good battery life on your side let me =
know
and I'll cleanup a more proper variation of it to send out.

> Here are the first results.

OK so the idle mask doesn't "change" from one time to another in any unexpe=
cted
ways to me.

When you see two IRQs like this; it's a firmware bug as described in the ot=
her
report I mentioned above.  HP will need to issue a new BIOS to fix this.

This is a laptop certified with Ubuntu (see
https://ubuntu.com/certified/202206-30367).  You should contact HP support =
and
ask them for a BIOS fix.

> [  332.466583] PM: Triggering wakeup from IRQ 9

When you're seeing these alone in the middle of the sleep it's because of t=
he
EC GPE firing to do $something.  In this case I believe it's the EC trying =
to
notify a new battery level.  Due to the above bug I mentioned I think these
together will "prevent" it from going back to the deepest state.

> That workaround works very well! Thanks :-)

Sure.  This is going to limit you quite a bit in terms of wakeup sources, b=
ut
IMO I think it's a worthwhile trade off for this problem.  You should hopef=
ully
be getting much better power consumption now over s2idle.
