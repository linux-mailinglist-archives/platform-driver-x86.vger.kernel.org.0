Thank you; even though this doesn't make 5.2 the tests that run against
your review branch were useful and uncovered bugs. Some are against the
olpc_battery branch -- I've sent the fix to power-supply maintainer and

They're now being reported somewhat redundantly, please drop the
patches from your branch or replace it with ones I'll submit shortly.
