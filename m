Yeah, sorry, typed as an example only, and will use strscpy

I'm not hugely comfortable with that. If for some reason it broke things
for Dell customers I wouldn't want to be responsible :) I'd rather they
made the changes and were able to test it - I know that's what I'd
prefer if it was the other way around. Apologies if I'm being over cautious!
I've added the new Dell kernel group email to the thread so they're aware :)
