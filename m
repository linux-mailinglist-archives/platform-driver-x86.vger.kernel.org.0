Ah yes, that means the interface could be looked up through /sys/class/hwmon
too, that is probably the safest route to go then, as the
/sys/devices/platform/asus-nb-wmi/ path might change if we e.g. ever
convert the asus-wmi code to use the new wmi bus interface.

Now that you have confirmed that any writes to
/sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile override any custom profiles
I wonder if p-p-d needs to take this into account at all though.

The easiest way to deal with this in p-p-d, is just to not deal
with it at all...    If that turns out to be a bad idea, we
can always reconsider and add some special handling to p-p-d for
this later.

Regards,

Hans
