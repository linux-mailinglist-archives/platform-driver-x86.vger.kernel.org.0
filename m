I am familiar with this and I do totally agree. I believe HW
sequencing is available since sandy-bridge from 2011, so it will
suffice for modern platforms. Honestly me and my developer friends
never understood why this driver needs to still focus on SW sequencing
altogether, it seems like a (possibly buggy) relic that just slows
down the vital parts. So I'd say it is a good idea to move the HW
sequencing parts, basically splitting it, but still add a RO/RW flag
to the module to be extra safe.

This is an understandable reason and thank you for working on it.
