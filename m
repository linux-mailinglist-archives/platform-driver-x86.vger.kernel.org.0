OK. I get it. Your preference is to have CnQF getting ON only when

1. BIOS advertises CnQF is "supported" and/or
2. Sysfs knob is set to ON. and
3. the static-slider (platform_profile) is set to "balanced"

In rest of the cases, (low-power or performance) the control would still
remain with the static-slider so that, user can make his own choices.

If that's the case, let me have a word with the windows team also on how
we can have user experiences same across OSes and come back.

Thank you for your feedback.
