Yes! You are correct. I completely missed this.

This was my first thought but I found out fwupd uses this interface.
I'll leave the ABI as is to not incur in regressions.

Thanks! I'll clean them in the next revision.

I'm not sure what you mean by this. If you mean this API should also
offer a way to create the Authentication group, I agree!

I was just hoping to get feedback from other maintainers before doing
that. I want to know if this approach passes the "smell" test for
everyone.

I agree and I believe this API has this capability. You can do this:

static int power_on_lid_open_read(struct device *dev, long aux, const char =
**str)
{
	...
}

static int power_on_lid_open_write(struct device *dev, long aux, const char=
 *str, size_t count)
{
	...
}

static ssize_t power_on_lid_open_prop_read(struct device *dev, long aux, en=
um fwat_property prop,
					   char *buf)
{
	...
}

DEFINE_FWAT_OPS(power_on_lid_open, enumeration);

...

static const struct fwat_attr_config * const galaxybook_fwat_config[] =3D {
	FWAT_CONFIG_AUX("power_on_lid_open", 0644,
			GB_ATTR_POWER_ON_LID_OPEN,
			&power_on_lid_open_ops,
			galaxybook_fwat_props,
			ARRAY_SIZE(galaxybook_fwat_props)),
	...
	NULL
}

I.e, you can define ops for each "firmware attribute" (aka
attribute_group).

I feel the _props approach is currently a bit ugly though, and there is
room for improvement in the boilerplate department.

In the samsung-galaxybook case I decided to define a single struct
fwat_attr_ops because I didn't want to make the diff too ugly. The
*_acpi_{get,set}() functions that already exist are used in other parts
of the driver, and I would have to change a few lines to make it work.

BTW, you can pass a drvdata pointer to devm_fwat_device_register().

I decided to make this a single callback defined in struct
fwat_dev_config. I went for this because I didn't like the idea of a
different function for each attribute_group because it would just be a
bunch of functions.

Do you think the struct fwat_attr_config * list achieves this? Could it
be improved in some way?

I can certainly add these macros, but they would be for "firmware
attributes" defined entirely manually, using struct fwat_attribute.
Actually I thought of adding these, but I didn't do it because I wanted
to get something working at first and then add some of these extra
helpers.

Thank you! As I said before, feedback is always welcome.

I feel this API already accomplishes the requirements (which I agree
with) you listed, albeit with some (maybe a bit too much) boilerplate.
However your questions make me realise documentation is still lacking, I
will make it better for the next revision.

If you have more concrete areas of improvement, please let me know! I
know there is room for improvement. Especially with naming.

I agree! I'd like to know maintainers opinion on this.

Device attributes already have a lot of helpers for creating some
common attributes, see [1].

I feel like every driver, subsystem, interface, etc. Has VERY different
requirements for how sysfs attributes/groups should work. IMO there
wouldn't be a lot of benefit in providing this infrastructure for other
subsystems, either because they already have something in place or
because it wouldn't exactly fit their needs. Kernel ABI is very diverse.

These syfs interfaces are very old and there are good reasons why they
are the way they are now. I don't think is a bad think to have to
develop infrastructures for each subsystem!

I hope so!
