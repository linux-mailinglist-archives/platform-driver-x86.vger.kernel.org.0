Hi Hans & Enrico

OK, I've just sent a new patch which conditionally configures GPIOs for b=
oards with older firmware's
(older than 4.10.0).

This is followed up by the patch I really want to try and get in, which i=
s to add support for APU5
and APU6. Particularly APU5 is quite interesting to me and significantly =
different to previous
boards in that it has a lot more mpcie slots that can be used for LTE mod=
ules or wifi cards. This
creates the realisation that the reset and sim-swap lines are always wire=
d to the LTE slots, not to
the mpcie slots (although often they overlap in functionality), so naming=
 is corrected here. That
said, I don't think the reset lines function on most iterations of boards=
, so possibly supporting
those lines with GPIOs is redundant anyway...

APU6 is also a special order and is essentially the same as an APU4, so I=
 have added detection for
this also.

I don't know if it's useful, but I uploaded a couple of scripts for beepi=
ng and flashing the leds.
Here I just used globs to handle the different naming on the different bo=
ards (since I need to
handle the older Alix boards as well). Enrico, is this useful to you?

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 https://github.com/nippynetworks/gpio-utils


As an aside, these boards are super easy to flash as they support flashro=
m. So I'm personally giving
some thought to bundling an updater into our software build. The generic =
bios is quite slow to
startup and I would like to prepare a customised version with shorter tim=
eouts. Happy to work with
you on something separately if this is interesting?

Hans, thanks if you can look this over.

Regards

Ed W
