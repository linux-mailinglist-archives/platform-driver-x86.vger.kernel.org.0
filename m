Hi


The platform-driver-x86 maintainers should've probably been

It seems these module parameters are neither readable nor writable,
is that intentional?

Maybe

  fixp_linear_interpolate(0, 0, a->props.max_brightness, b->props.max_brigh=
tness, a->props.brightness);

? (from `linux/fixp-arith.h`)

`backlight_update_status()` returns a negative errno while the notifier cha=
in
expects something else. It would probably be better to return `NOTIFY_DONE`
in all cases. Currently a suitable error from `backlight_update_status()` w=
ill
stop the notifier chain.

I think `target` is not put in case of error. You probably need to add some=
thing like:

  if (target) {
    ret =3D devm_add_action_or_reset(&wdev->dev, put_device_wrapper, target=
);
    if (ret < 0)
      return ret;
  }

`devm_kzalloc()` would probably be better and you should check if `!priv`.

If you switch to `devm_add_action_or_reset()`, this will not be needed.

If you switch to `devm_kzalloc()`, this won't be needed.

Lastly, is it expected that these bugs will be properly fixed?
