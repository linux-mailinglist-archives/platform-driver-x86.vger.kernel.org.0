I'll let them weigh in on this again if they want to, but I think it
was clear from those threads that this is a new way to use the class.
Armin's comment was related to the fan curve setting John was
discussing, which is specifically covered by the hwmon subsystem.
Hwmon does not cover platform profiles or PPT.

Yeah, it's a driver for those interfaces... If you want an agnostic
BMOF driver then make one. This isn't that.

You don't seem to, no. The suggestion was to use the component  driver
API to aggregate the Other Method driver with the capability data
driver so that the firmware-attributes class is only loaded when both
are present. That is decidedly different from breaking the kernel's
WMI driver requirements and merging two GUID's into one driver.

What exactly do you think the following does?

 +MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(wmi, gamezone_wmi_id_table);

The capability data interface has a data block instance for every
attribute in every fan mode. SPL has one for quiet, balanced,
performance, and custom. The method for getting that data block (page)
is the same as calling get/set in Other Method (0x01030100 -
0x0103FF00). Every page produces different values for each attribute,
but I am only ever retrieving the instance for custom (0x0103FF00) as
that's the only one where setting that method ID in Other Method
changes the values on the Legion Go. It is the only relevant data for
userspace. Other Gaming Series laptops might treat this differently,
where every fan mode has an applicable range. I'll need to do more
testing on other hardware to confirm that. In any case, this isn't
relevant as I'm dropping the gamezone check (as I've stated multiple
times in this discussion) and always setting/getting the custom method
ID for a given attribute.

I was pretty clear...
