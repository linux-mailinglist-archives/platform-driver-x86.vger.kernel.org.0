ROG Keyboard devices have multiple HID endpoints. This driver only
hooks to the 0xff31 endpoint. So the rest of the endpoints should not
be modified. Except for minor fixups, see below.

The reason the rename exists here is because the devices this driver
applied to originally did not have proper names (e.g. I2C). The new
ROG devices do have proper names, so there is no reason to deviate
from those. It also eliminates a point of failure in which the
hid-asus driver is not loaded, if your point is consistency. Ie, as we
add more keyboard IDs, those would then not be renamed when hid-asus
starts to load them.

As for affected software (per your other email), yes it is only
Inputplumber when running on its fallback mode without access to its
OOT modules that disable this driver. Because it had an architectural
decision to rely on hardcoded evdev/phys names for most devices
instead of more canonical vid/pid/capability matches. The phys part is
especially problematic as it also hardcodes the bus node of a lot of
devices. There is a PR open to remove the matches for the Ally units
though.

If you want to know about other software that relies on names, SDL is
the main one. And the reason for that is so that it matches the kernel
driver. E.g., when a playstation 5 controller loads using
hid_playstation, it has a different mapping and name than when it
loads through hid core. My software also relies on it for WMI
keyboards, as those have a vid:pid of 0:0 so it is unavoidable.

SDL does not map keyboards so it is not affected. Moreover, as this
series makes it so the device has the same name as with the driver not
loaded, software such as SDL would have a fallback mapping for that
name already.

Because the checks above apply to e.g., touchpad devices. This was
actually a bug with this series in previous versions. Only the report
fixups should be skipped. Specifically, with previous versions a HID
application mute was skipped, which caused certain keyboards to show
up as range finders if I recall (there is a comment for it in this
driver).

The report fixups that are below this check are only applicable to the
0xff31 devices that emit 0x5a events. Specifically, this driver
"abuses" the HID subsystem a bit to make the vendor report, which is
not a HID input device, appear as an input device, by mutating its
descriptor. But refactoring that would be too painful. At least with
this we make the fixup apply more precisely to only those devices.

I kindly ask you finish your comments until tomorrow evening, so I can
resend this series.
