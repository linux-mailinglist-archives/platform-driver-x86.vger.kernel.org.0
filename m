I think that failing the probe with -ENODEV, with a dev_info() explaining why when
all six sensors return 0 would be good yes, that should also fix those 2
issues on https://github.com/t-8ch/linux-gigabyte-wmi-driver/.

Since you alreayd have bugreports of boards where this does not work,
please don't spend too much time on this. I guess those older DSDT-s will
also just return an integer with value 0.

Ok.

Hmm, so maybe this can be used to limit the amount of reported temperature
sensors, IOW if sensors 5 and 6 report 0, only register 4 sensors ?

Good, you should probably ask reporters there to provide the output of:

grep . /sys/class/dmi/id/* 2> /dev/null

Ran as a normal user (so that the serial-numbers will be skipped) so that
you will have DMI strings to match on if you decide to go that route.

Actually the "Directly access the it87 registers" option is potentially interesting
since it will allow using the it87 driver which gives a lot more features.

I actually wrote a rough outline of how something like this could work here:

https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=204807#c47

Note I'm not sure if that is the right approach, but it definitely is an
option. It seems that this one might also solve the X470-AORUS-ULTRA-GAMING
case (https://github.com/t-8ch/linux-gigabyte-wmi-driver/issues/2)

Hopefully the direct-register ACPI/WMI access methods will also allow
reading the super-io vendor and product ids so that we can be reasonably
sure that we are not loading the wrong driver on a board.

OTOH the WMI-temp method approach may also work on boards where the sensors
(or some of the sensors) are not supported.

I'm afraid there is no obviously correct answer here. If you feel like it
experimenting with the "Directly access the it87 registers" option would certainly
be interesting IMHO.

It might be good to get hwmon subsystems maintainer's opinion on this
before sinking a lot of time into this though (added to the Cc).

Jean, Guenter,

Thomas has been working on a WMI driver to expose various motherboard
temperatures on a gigabyte board where the IO-addresses for the it87 chip
are reserved by ACPI. We are discussing how best to deal with this, there
are some ACPI methods to directly access the super-IO registers (with locking
to protect against other ACPI accesses). This reminded me of an idea I had
a while ago to solve a similar issue with an other superIO chip, abstract
the superIO register access-es using some reg_ops struct and allow an ACPI/WMI
driver to provide alternative reg_ops:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=204807#c47

Do you think this is a good idea (or a bad one)? And would something like that
be acceptable to you ?

Regards,

Hans
