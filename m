--- Comment #6 from Mario Limonciello (AMD) (mario.limonciello@amd.com) ---
The tough thing with this bug is that in this design the IRQ is shared both=
 for
the ACPI SCI as well as for the GPIO controller.  There are patches in the
kernel's s2idle handling created specifically for that case.  But it means =
when
you're dealing with a spurious interrupt you don't know which device it was
REALLY destined for.

Looking at your GPIO output it seems that pin 32 switches from output pin in
the good scenario to input pin in the bad scenario.  Can you try to correla=
te
if this happens every single time you see a problem or it's also a red herr=
ing?

Sorry what bug?  Are you talking about
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/455cd867b85b53fd3602345f9b8a8facc5=
51adc9
?

I didn't see the issue listed there, I was hoping to understand the timing =
of
it.

Something I'm wondering is if maybe it's an IRQ destined for the GPIO
controller but the GPIO controller driver isn't yet loaded?  This could be
particularly relevant if it's not in your initramfs but rather loaded after=
 you
entered your encryption key (noticed root=3D/dev/mapper/cryptroot)

Could you please turn on dynamic debugging for pinctrl_amd (pinctrl.dyndbg=
=3D+p
on your kernel command line )and share a log with it reproducing?

> pcie_aspm=3Dforce

FYI - this is generally not a safe thing to do.  If you remove this from yo=
ur
kernel command line can you reproduce the issue?

I think Mark will have to comment whether it's something they're aware of,
tracking, etc regression wise.
