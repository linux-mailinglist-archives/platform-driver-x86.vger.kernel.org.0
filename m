Ok, then firmware-attributes definitely is a good match for these
and I see you have already moved this functionality to
the firmware-attributes class API for v4, good :)

Yes.

No preference for the naming, the firmware-attributes API just
specifies how userspace can find out if something is
an int/string/enumand valid values / range. Not naming of
the attributes.

No unless you add new functionality like a new type to
the firmware attributes API then these should not be
documented there. It would be good to document them in
driver specific documentation.

Right, note the existing examples all actually read a list of
firmware-attributes directly from the BIOS using a generic interface,
which is somewhat different from how you plan to use this.

Using the firmware-attributes class to control settings where each
attribute needs to be manually added to the driver is new, but is
e.g. also planned for asus-wmi and some other upcoming drivers.

Right, so for the camera side of this, intercepting the key making
the ACPI call and then reporting SW_CAMERA_LENS_COVER definitely
is the right thing to do.

The microphone also getting muted not at the mixer level but at
some other hw level as a side-effect is something unique to
samsung, I guess we can just ignore this wrt reporting it to
userspace. Once GNOME/KDE get support for showing an OSD on
SW_CAMERA_LENS_COVER changes (1) we will have a nice notification
to the user and the mic also getting muted as a side-effect will
then just be a Samsung peculiarity we will have to live with.

1) now that more drivers are starting to actually report this
I hope that at least GNOME will get OSD support for this soon.

That is correct.

That is also correct.

No, normally the EC controls the hw-mixer in the sound/codec chip
and that sends an event. But that appears to not be happening here?

We could add a SW_INTERNAL_MIC_MUTED event I guess. Although with this
being a Samsung only thing I doubt userspace will ever get support
for that and if it does then we end up with one OSD replacing the
other quite quickly since typicalluy only 1 OSD will be shown at
a time. So as I mentioned above, I would just go with only reporting
SW_CAMERA_LENS_COVER and then consider the mic also getting muted
a Smasung specific side-effect of this.

Some UVC cameras also have an electronic "cover" switch rather then
an actual cover, I guess those might also mute the builtin mic
for UVc cams with a builtin mic, so having this is a side-effect
is not that far fetched.

camera_mic_privacy or block_recording are both fine I think.

The thinkpad_apci driver has /sys/bus/platform/devices/thinkpad_acpi/dytc_lapmode
which will read 1 when the laptop thinks it is not on a table (and thus will
limit max temperatures a bit to avoid someone getting a hot lap when
actually having the laptop on their lap.

I'm not aware of any other drivers having something similar. I do think
that power-profiles-daemon checks the dytc_lapmode thing, so it might
be good to have some standard interface for this, but that would need
to be designed / decided upon .

For v1 of your patch I would just dev_dbg() log these events and
otherwise do nothing.

ATM there is no userspace API to communicate e.g. "charging stopped
due to charge end threshold" and this is the first time I hear about
us getting events from the hw for this.

So for this one too I would say just dev_dbg() log the event and
otherwise do nothing.

We can always add an API later if we have an idea how userspace
could / will use this.

Hans
