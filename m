I'll have to think on that one then; the problem there is that the
cio2-bridge is just given ACPI HIDs for the sensors as "ok to parse
this", and of course the INT347A that is being dealt with here should
already be supported on most Surface platforms via the intel-skl-int3472
stuff, so once the ov8865 edits are (posted and) accepted and that
driver is supported my plan would be to add it into the bridge. So we'd
need a way to exclude Go2 from that if we wanted to define all the
software nodes parts in a single board file instead.

Not sure how this is usually guarded against; we could do a DMI match at
the start of the init function to confirm it's running on a Go2 and exit
if not?
