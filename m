Good to know!

I'm going through the sysfs groups attached to the platform device and I
noticed some attributes may depend on subdrivers being initialized
first. If this is the case, ibm_init() has to be called inside the
platform driver probe for this to work. Like this:

static int tpacpi_probe(struct platform_device *pdev)
{
	/* Input init */
	...
	/* Subdrivers init */
	...
		ret =3D ibm_init(&ibms_init[i]);
	...
}

static int __init thinkpad_acpi_module_init(void)
{
	...
	tpacpi_pdev =3D platform_create_bundle(&tpacpi_pdriver, tpacpi_probe,
					     NULL, 0, NULL, 0);
	...
}

Of course this complicates things, so another approach is to just use

	platform_profile_register()

instead of the devm_ version.

Of course, the first approach has the advantage that devres is now
usable, so I'd go for that, but that's for you to decide.
