I wouldn't mind giving this a bit more time to maybe collect some more
reviews.

The only real functionality that depends on this and would be ready for
5.12 right now is the performance profile. Everything else will have to
go into 5.13 anyway (still need to cleanup and prepare patches for
that), so 5.13 seems to be the better target for me.
