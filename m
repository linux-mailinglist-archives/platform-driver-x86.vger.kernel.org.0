            Bug ID: 216150
           Summary: ideapad-laptop exposes only two keyboard backlight
                    levels, instead of three
           Product: Drivers
           Version: 2.5
    Kernel Version: 5.18.1
          Hardware: All
                OS: Linux
              Tree: Mainline
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
          Priority: P1
         Component: Platform_x86
          Assignee: drivers_platform_x86@kernel-bugs.osdl.org
          Reporter: tinozzo123@tutanota.com
        Regression: No

I own a Lenovo IdeaPad 5 14ARE05, which has three keyboard brightness level=
s:
off, low and high, which are cycled through with the Fn+space key combo.
However, ideapad-laptop.c sets max_brightness to 1, which means that the
brightness is either off (0) or on (1). This means that I'm unable to select
the high intensity brightness from ACPI like I could on a ThinkPad (I don't=
 own
one, but thinkpad_acpi.c sets max_brightness to 2, so I guess that it doesn=
't
have that problem).


Still, I don't know if this feature is present on all IdeaPad laptops. I
couldn't find any documentation on this (there is an article on Lenovo's
support, but it only refers to ThinkPads*). Even the user manual of my lapt=
op
doesn't mention this (it only says that it has keyboard backlight, not that=
 it
has three levels). Finally, I never tested Windows, so I don't know if Leno=
vo
Vantage provides any more settings.

Also, small note: right now, if the keyboard brightness is at high intensity
(with Fn+space, since there is no other way to do it), then is set to 0 usi=
ng
ACPI (and *not* with Fn+space), then set to 1 again with ACPI (still *not* =
with
Fn+space), the result is that the keyboard backlight will turn on with high
intensity (and the next Fn+space will turn it off) instead of low.
