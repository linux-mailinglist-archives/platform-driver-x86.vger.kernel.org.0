Right now the intel spi driver has a _(DANGEROUS)_ tag [1], this is
preventing the kernel engineers from compiling the driver into
different distros.
A couple of months ago I tried to modify the driver and make it RO [2]
 but the drivers author told me that they don't want to remove the
tag, even if the driver is compiled without any write/erase
functionality as I proposed.
The driver is fixed as the author claims but, as I said, they want to
preserve the tag.
This patch is close to what we need if we can't use the intel spi mechanism.
