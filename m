That doesn't matter for this case.

Okay fine. Now you come around the corner with undocumented Intel
devices and make your first semi-valid point. Why did it take you so
long? Why did you seemingly just try to derail the discussion before?
Is the documentation non-existent or just NDA?
May I remind you that from a CPU view it doesn't matter if the PCH or
some other thing attached to the CPU's bus provides the mapping.

So if that is your concern, then the solution would be to probe if we
see a PCH or FCH?
