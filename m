Hi Werner,

I've actually no problem with the diff itself :-) but what I want is us=20
to explain what we're doing in the changelog text. E.g., if you add code=20
ignore something to avoid warning spam, please state that in the=20
changelog (not just "handle" which is actually quite different than=20
"ignore" if we start to really go into language details, yeah,=20
"ignoring" is kind of "handling" too but must less precise, I think you=20
get the point).

Some things can be read from the patch itself, but it usually means more=20
work and we rarely can infer motivations behind any non-trivial change so
it's always useful to record such otherwise hidden details to the=20
changelog. Nobody is perfect in this, I don't expect that, but please try=
=20
to avoid vague expressions when writing the description.

Stating why they're ignored (beyond just warning spam itself) is even=20
better when e.g. you know something else handles the same=20
event already. But it's understandable if you don't always know such=20
details which itself might be useful knowledge for somebody wanting to=20
change the code later (was something done on purpose or just because=20
we did not know better at that time? is often what I'm left to ponder=20
after reading a change from history, if changelog doesn't give that=20
detail, I'll haveto guess and hope for the best).

In general, if somebody asks about some detail from a submitter, it's=20
worth to stop to consider if it's something should be added to the=20
changelog (when no change to the diff itself is asked). It could point out=
=20
something in the change that is not obvious enough. We're not writing=20
these changelogs just for the people around now but also for the people=20
that come after us (and might only see the change from the commit history
as there's no guarantee any of us will be there then and/or doesn't=20
remember anyway).

That also means if I don't seem to be directly asking a question, I=20
usually don't expect email reply (other than in a form of a new version of=
=20
the patch that addresses the feedback :-)).

--=20
 i.
