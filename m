Keep them coming :-)

Yes.

I think they are meant to be named consistently with what the native
UEFI setup interface calls them.
And yes, they should be documented.

The firmware-attributes don't really have a standardized semantic.
Here the standardization is more about the discovery and interaction.
Somebody can build a generic UI to change these settings, without the UI
knowing anything about what the setting actually does.

If the setting maps to a another, more specific interface, that should
be used.

Optimally the ACPI event would integrate with the ACPI battery driver.
See the handling of POWER_SUPPLY_STATUS_NOT_CHARGING in
drivers/acpi/battery.c.
Does the battery report the current rate as 0 when limiting?
Then something like acpi_battery_handle_discharging() could be used.
