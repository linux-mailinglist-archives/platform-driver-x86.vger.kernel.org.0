Software node is a representation of (missed and / or quirked)
firmware nodes in the code.

Software node _is_ a board file part. The idea behind that is that the
driver, which requires any additional / necessary property that has
been missed in the firmware nodes, wouldn't need special treatment if
that property comes from a board file rather than firmware.
