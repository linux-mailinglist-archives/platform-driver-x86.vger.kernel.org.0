Maybe also add a module parameter to force the i8042 workaround? This
change is likely to break the touchpad toggle for some devices similar
to Z570 (maybe Z580? Y580? idk), so people would at least have an
option to force enable it using the module parameter, before the
relevant entry gets added to the DMI table, the patch gets merged, and
the kernel gets updated.

Another note on the comments in patch 4:

        /*
         * Some IdeaPads don't really turn off touchpad - they only
         * switch the LED state. We (de)activate KBC AUX port to turn
         * the touchpad on and off.
         */
               /*
                * On older models the EC controls the touchpad and toggles =
it
                * on/off itself, in this case we report KEY_TOUCHPAD_ON/_OF=
F.
                * If the EC did not toggle, report KEY_TOUCHPAD_TOGGLE.
                */

These two comments would sound confusing to me if I read them without
having context on Ideapads. I mean this part where "EC controls the
touchpad and toggles it itself", but at the same time these laptops
"don't really turn off the touchpad". Could you rephrase it somehow,
so that it would be clear that there are models where the EC cares
about the touchpad because it toggles *either* the touchpad or at
least its LED?
