Unfortunately you never really answered my questions about v1
of this series:

https://lore.kernel.org/platform-driver-x86/a1f546c2-5c63-573a-c032-603c792f3f7c@redhat.com/

So looking at the linked CS35L41 HDA series there is a single
ACPI device node with a HID of CLSA0100 which describes
two CS35L41 amplifiers connected over I2C ?

I assume you are doing this work because there are also designs
where there is a similar CLSA0100 ACPI device which also describes
two CS35L41 amplifiers but then connected over SPI ?

It would really help if you can:

1. Answer my questions from v1
2. Provide a concrete example of a device where these changes will
be necessary to make things work, preferably with a link to an
actual ACPI DSDT of that device.

Until you can better clarify why this is necessary, this series
gets a nack from me. The i2c-mult-instantiate code is a hack to
deal with some rather sub-optimal choices made in DSDTs used on
devices shipped with Windows and unless absolutely necessary
I would rather not see this get expanded to SPI.

Regards,

Hans
