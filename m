Did not mean how it is called as who will call it. But as in the way
it is called does not match the desired behavior.

In any case, as I said, I am happy to work in a downstream POC. My
target usecase is very simple and I do not need/want to tie Display
Off to CRTC.

ie, I will do 2 and 4. I am already familiar with gamescope (including
having two sockets open to it at any given time). Then if we get
interesting results, we move on from there.

As I said I also want to catch the Sleep _DSMs. I do not care about
Display On/Off other than calling it properly (where properly = as in
Windows + a lot of debouncing) so that these handhelds do not get
confused.
