Hi all,

I'm left uncertain if there are any remaining concerns with all these gpio 
conversion patches (the 3 independent ones and the larger 
x86-android-tablets series)? While I see there were a few back and forth
items between you three, it sounded like there's nothing left to do and it 
was all just based on wrong impressions/understanding, is that correct 
deduction from my part?

There was also an almost promise from Hans to test the x86-android-tablets 
series, is that still on plan/pending?
