I don't think we have existing interfaces for things like wave / zoom /
neon effects.  I guess this could use the new CONFIG_LEDS_CLASS_MULTICOLOR
API to set the color + overall brightness, combined with a custom sysfs attribute
under the led_classdev's device's dir for selecting the things for which there
is no standard API ?

Hans
