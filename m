Ah I did not realize there was already some (read-only) precedence
for this in the psy subsystem.

Since there is precedence for this using
/sys/class/power_supply/<supply_name>/charge_behaviour

with an example contents of say:

[auto] inhibit-charge force-discharge

Works for me and having 1 file instead of 2 is better then
because this clearly encapsulates that inhibit-charge and
force-discharge are mutually exclusive.

Hans
