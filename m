Ok, good. So Intel folks this seems to be a way to move forward
with this. Please prepare a version 3 using this approach.

Right, for version 3 the commit message and ABI documentation changes
really need to clarify why multiple test-pattern files may be needed
mucy better. If possible please also include 1 or 2 _clear_ examples
of cases where more then 1 test-pattern file may be used.
