First off, ostensibly the purpose of the constraints is to indicate to
Windows when it can attempt to put the system into the deepest power
state.  Specifically, AFAICS, Windows is not expected to do so when
the current power state of a given device is shallower than the
relevant constraint.  Consequently, a constraint of D0 means that
effectively Windows is expected to ignore the given device as far as
Modern Standby goes.

In any case, this has no bearing on the behavior of suspend-to-idle in Linux.

Now, there may be other undocumented side-effects of setting a
constraint of D0 in Windows, but it is generally risky to rely on such
things.

Second, it is not entirely clear to me whether or not the future
versions of Windows will continue to use the constraints in the same
way.

There is a fundamental difference between Modern Standby and
suspend-to-idle already, as the former is opportunistic and the latter
is on-demand.  They can both follow the exact same set of rules.
