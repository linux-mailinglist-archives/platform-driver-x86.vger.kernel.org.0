They need to re-agree given the context below. It is one thing for
them to agree on it theoretically for settings that they might imagine
are persistent and another thing when in reality they are not.

You did not address this in your comment here.

The problem I am raising is that SPL, SPPT, and FPPT specifically are
not persistent enough to meet the guidelines of that interface.

[1] and [2] do not address this either.

I do not have an alternative planned, just noting that I'd like
everyone to be on the same page before we go ahead with this ABI.

To rephrase, your ABI style is not intuitive, because it contains
implementation details such as "gamezone", "capdata01", and "Other
Method", in addition to the ABI being hardcoded to the WMI structure
lenovo uses. The documentation uses those keywords as well.

I just brought up that you could have taken different design choices
to have a cleaner API, and at the same time avoided comments such as
the IdeaPad one or using the Legion name.

If I understand correctly your last sentence, Armin suggested much of
the same (ie combine and merge).

An industry practice cannot be a BIOS bug. If Lenovo has a practice of
using those interfaces in all of their BIOSes to allow for future
extension you'd need to take account of that.

Since there are Lenovo reps here they are more equipped to comment on
it than I am.

GUID tables loading !=3D drivers loading also, I would not pin that on
the kernel. You could bail on a stub implementation or require
multiple interfaces be present.

For the first part, see above. As for (ii) I only said they are
unnecessary during writing, not during probe or deriving _min, _max
which would be done once by userspace software.

WMI functions are accessible to all software in WIndows without any
limits and there are multiple WIndows software for Legion and Asus
devices that use those interfaces without limits.

So if it is a problem it is in the interest of Lenovo to fix this in
their BIOS, so that they remove that liability from both OSs. Here I
have to say that the max TDP of the device is limited by AMD CBS and
Lenovo has implemented overheating protection so it is actually quite
safe already.

So it is your choice to take on that overhead. If you do take it on,
make sure you dont do extra WMI calls and introduce a quirk system.

That's hardly an argument for making unnecessary calls unfortunately.

I do not understand what "I hard code the page to custom" means.

If you mean the capability data does not change you are right, they
are hardcoded in the decompiled ACPI I am pretty sure (it has been
close to a year now so I might be forgetting).

When reviewing your code, I saw that it does two checks: one for
checking whether in custom mode and bailing, and one for checking caps
and then bailing. Which equals 3 calls.

It's good that you will be fixing that/I hope you will be fixing that.
It is not clear from your comment. Please try to skip the capability
call too.
