Jorge, thank you for your continued work on this.

I will try to get a detailed review of this done next week (no time this
week, sorry).

But before then can you please restructure the patch series to make
it easier to review ?  ATM the series seems to be the original v1
patch + patches on top addressing review comments. That is a somewhat
unusual way to address review comments. Usually new versions include
improvements from review directly in the patch introducing the change
which got commented on.

What I would like to see for v4 of the series is a patch series like
this (with all the hp-bioscfg patches squashed together before doing
this new split):

[PATCH 1/x] Move the existing HP drivers to the new hp subdir (instead of doing this in 5/6)
[PATCH 2/x] Introduce the main bioscfg.h file + *-attributes.c files, yes this won't
            compile, but without a Makefile pointing to it that is fine
[PATCH 3/x] Add the main bioscfg.c + Makefile + Kconfig changes

Note feel free to split patch 2/x in maybe 2 or 3 patches adding a few
*-attributes.c files at a time.

The idea here is to make the individual .patch files smaller because
I personally find that reviewing big patch files does not work well
(I tend to loose track of everything which is going on if the patch
is too big / I loose my way because of too much scrolling).

Regards,

Hans
