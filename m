That's fair, I'll change that. My hope was that we someday may find a
way to dynamically query devices, but then we'll have to update the
registry anyway.

Interesting, I wasn't aware of that. I was aware of Bastien's work
towards implementing user-space support for this but I hadn't yet looked
at it in detail (e.g. the "fallback to quiet" is new to me).

Pretty much, yeah. AFAICT booting doesn't reset it, but hard-resetting
the EC does. Same difference though.

I can only really speak on the behavior of my Surface Book 2. On that
device, the CPU is passively cooled, but the discrete GPU is actively
cooled, so I can actually only really talk about active cooling behavior
for the dGPU.

On that, at least, the normal (Windows calls this 'recommended') profile
feels like it targets quiet operation. Using the dGPU with that profile
pretty much ensures that the dGPU will be limited in performance by a
thermal limiter (around 75°C to 80°C; at least it feels that way), while
the fan is somewhat audible but definitely not at maximum speed.
Changing the profile to any higher profile (Windows calls those 'better
performance' and 'best performance'), the fan becomes significantly more
audible. I'm not entirely sure if the performance increase can solely be
attributed to cooling though.

As far as I've heard, that behavior seems to be similar on other devices
with fans for CPU cooling, but I can try to get some more feedback on
that.

Based on all of this, I thought that this would most resemble a 'quiet'
profile. But I'd also be fine with your second suggestion. Calling the
last two options 'balanced performance' and 'performance' might be a bit
closer to the Windows naming scheme. It doesn't seem like the normal
profile does much power limiting in terms of actually capping the power
limit of the dGPU, so I think calling this 'balanced' would also make
sense to me, especially in light of Gnome's defaults.
