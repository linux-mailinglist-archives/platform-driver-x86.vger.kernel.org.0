It does clean up the memory, but it does so immediately after the device has been unregistered, even
if a file is open. The get/put ensures that if files are open, the memory isn't cleaned up until the
files are closed.

I can show that this happens without the get/put,

	open()
	unbind device -> devm action called -> kfree(priv)
	ioctl() -> priv accessed

but it doesn't blow up. I guess because the former location of priv is accessible by container_of on
the miscdev. But that memory was freed right?
