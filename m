I do not insist, but my objection here is the terminology (active state,
inactive state vs. 0, 1 or other way around) and inconsistency with what you
put as a value and what comment says taking into account / (or
negation) of the real signal.

Ideally yes, would be nice to have it indeed requested since it's in use even
from the Linux kernel perspective (one may debug its usage or see via user
space, note as well that non-requested pin maybe easily altered in the Linux).

But if you guarantee nothing of this happens, feel free to amend the comment
to make it more clear and proceed.
