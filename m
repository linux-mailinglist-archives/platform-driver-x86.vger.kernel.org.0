I would do it like this with an interactive rebase:

b # apply the generic parts of "platform/x86: think-lmi: use correct possible_values delimters"
pick c2fbd30a7b15 platform/x86: think-lmi: add missing type attribute
pick 644923d17048 platform/x86: think-lmi: Add possible_values for ThinkStation
f a92fa3cda0d6 platform/x86: think-lmi: use correct possible_values delimters

The -stable process should be automated with the proper stable Cc.

Given that this technically breaks ABI it may better to keep it out of
stable, though.

FYI I looked at the only user of this ABI that I know, fwupd, and it
should gracefully handle this change.
It accepts both ',' and ';' as separator.

The Fixes tag refers to the original commit that introduced the fixed
issue.
In this case it would be the commit adding the think-lmi driver:

Fixes: a40cd7ef22fb ("platform/x86: think-lmi: Add WMI interface support on Lenovo platforms")
