With v2 of my patches (which have been merged) we do bail out as soon as it is clear that there is no enum-type (*) attribute
with instance_id 0. That is pretty-much the earliest that we can bail and that works fine.

What I was wondering is if that is the right thing to do though. On the E5570 there seem to be no enum/int/str attributes at all but what if there are enum + int attributes + no str attributes for example ?

Also maybe the BIOS password interface on its own, without having any attributes at all has some value by itself ?

*) enums are the first type we check for

> Also I was not cc'ed on the mail threads where the bugs were discussed so going further please add me and Divya for reporting any issues on the driver

Yes that was my mistake, sorry about that. I'll make sure to Cc Divya and you on future emails about the dell-wmi-sysman driver.

Regards,

Hans
