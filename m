Only for those with recent enough firmware. As already mentioned, we
can't expect users to do BIOS upgrade in the *field* or have an
dependencies between BIOS and kernel versions.

Does that cause any actual failures ?

I'm fine with (actually prefer) having the same naming also on apu5.
Actually, your argument is exactly why I did it this way for apu[234].

Feel free to repost the patch for adding apu5 only.

Might be trivial for your case, lucky for you. My cases (and those I
just got distant reports from) aren't so trivial, most of this hasn't
much to do with actual coding (unfortunately, embedded world isn't as
agile as some might want it to be)

I know, but on some they are. The final implementation will take care
of that (at least if we can gather that information somewhere).

ACK, that's pretty much my information - just don't recall the exact
details for each one. (would have to dig into schematics again). I can
confirm that each one (of those I have/had) has at least one msata,
one pcie, one usb+sim - some have multiple functions.

But I still wonder what exactly you mean w/ "LTE-Port". Just an alias
for those having USB+SIM ? (sorry if I'm too nitpicking, but I've
learned that exact terminology often is very important - perhaps I've
been a lawyer in some former life ;-))

Let's rephrase it: those w/ USB+SIM also have a reset line.

NAK. They still can serve several kinds of purpose, eg. those w/ USB or
PCIE *and* SIM are by far not limited for modem's (and I'm really glad
about that).

Does it make any sense having WLAN, SSD, DAC, etc in an "modem port" ?
I don't believe so.

Sorry, I've just been confused, believing that NGFF (in its different
types) was an superset of mpcie - both can carry different signal types,
You're right, I've been mistaken on that.

I've just been looking for some adequate name for those kinds of ports
which may have pcie, usb, sata, etc, all on one connector. Suggestions
welcomed.

Now we have at least two types of such things now on the table:
mpcie/msata/usb (like apu*) and M.2. From embedded world, I know of
several (propritary) port types fitting into similar category.
PDMI and similar stuff (apple connectors, ...) probably, too

I'll have to rethink what's the optimal approach with that, probably
by a new subsystem (even though there's a little bit of overlap with
extconn). Yes, that's a whole topic on it's own - we went quite
offtopic.

> We just need the GPIOs exposing in some way. Nothing else. Everything else is done in userspace

Might be fine for you, but not for me. Exposing raw gpios isn't an
entirely good idea (except for rare cases where kernel really cannot
know what's the actual function of those IOs might be)

> Not disagreeing, but it seems about as reliable as doing a software upgrade. If you do those then

Already mentioned, BIOS is very different from OS. We've got several
techniques for rescuing a machine from failed kernel (even remotely),
but no such thing for broken BIOS - that requires physical replacement
in the field.

> Hint: use netboot for simplest setup

Assuming there is another server in the LAN. We don't have this luxury.
We're already happy with an dialup land line or some serial link routed
out of some PLC. Remember: this is embedded, not office PC.

Yes, and you suggested was removing the LEDs entirely. This means more
radical changes, including loosing it all on older bios (which still is
heavily used in the field).

It certainly would be much simpler, if we could just run BIOS upgrades
everywhere,
but then the question would be: who's gonna pay the bill for that ? And
who's responsible if anything goes wrong ?

Very most of those people will only notice something completely new
appearing - already mentioned: haven't found a single distro that had
that enabled, nobody in the apu community seem to even know about it.

Congratulations, you're the first person I've ever known who was
actually using it :p

I (maintainer) considered it experimental due to lack of testing
and being a bit unreliable.

And thanks for that report.

On which boards did you see that ?

For my boards (don't recall which combinations I've actually tested),
it seemed to work sometimes, but not very reliable. (probably because
of the bug you've mentioned).
