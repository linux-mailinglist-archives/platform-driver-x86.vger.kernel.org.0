> My thinking for it was ensuring that a process that wrote to /sys/devices/platform/asus-nb-wmi/throttle_thermal_policy would force an update across all. I think perhaps I should move the notify to throttle_thermal_policy_store() instead which only activates when the path is written.

We definitely want the notify when the change is done by the kernel
itself through the hotkey, which would not happen when the
notify call gets moved to store.

The question which I had was if we should also notify on store-s
(writes to the sysfs file from userspace processes). The current
drivers don't do a notify on store, but that seems wrong. Also
see my other somewhat long email.

Thinking more about this I think we should actually do the notify
from the platform_profile_store() function inside
drivers/acpi/platform_profile.c, that way all drivers will
consistently do the notify after a store.

This does mean that the asus-wmi code should only call
platform_profile_notify() in the hotkey path as I suggested
in my original proposal, so that we don't call notify twice
for a single store.

###

So summarizing my current thoughts on this:

1. The asus-wmi code should only call platform_profile_notify()
in the hotkey path, to be consistent with other existing drivers.

2. We should document the POLLPRI stuff in
Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-platform_profile
This documentation should say that POLLPRI will be raised on
any changes, independent of those changes coming from a userspace
write; or coming from another source (typically a hotkey
triggered profile change handled either directly by the embedded-controller
or fully handled inside the kernel).

3. We should make platform_profile_store() function inside
drivers/acpi/platform_profile.c call platform_profile_notify()
on a successful store to make all the drivers consistently do
a notify after a store.

And I think it might make sense to fold 2. + 3. into a single
patch. I'll put writing that patch on my to do list.

Regards,

Hans
