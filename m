Hi,

the battery hook is being registered to all ACPI batteries present on a gi=
ven system,
so you need to do some manual filtering when .add_battery() is called.

As a side note: i suspect that "newer" Dell machines use a different inter=
face for controlling
battery charging, since the Dell Power Manager software on my machine seem=
s to provide some
additional features not found in this token-based interface.

Unfortunately i am not sure if reverse-engineering the Dell software is le=
gal, does the kernel
community have some helping guides in this area? If it is legal, then i wo=
uld happily volunteer
to do the reverse-engineering.

Otherwise maybe someone at Dell can provide some clarifications if a diffe=
rent interface for controlling
battery charging exists and how to use it?

Thanks,
Armin Wolf
