I think there is a misunderstanding here: the hwmon device exported by the=
 WMI interface
will also contain temperature and fan speed sensors (provided by the WMI i=
nterface), so
this would be a standard hwmon device.

The only difference between this hwmon device and the hwmon device exposed=
 by the ACPI interface
would be that:

- the hwmon interface exposed by the ACPI interface also allows for manual=
 fan control
- the hwmon interface exposed by the ACPI interface does not support the f=
anx_max attribute

So i think there should be no problem with having two hwmon devices on som=
e models, since both are
usable independently from each other.
