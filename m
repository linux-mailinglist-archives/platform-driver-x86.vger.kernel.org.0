Okay, this seems like a different story.
The software nodes shouldn't appear on its own in the generic code.
When we use software nodes API in it, it means that we have tried
other providers _explicitly_ and haven't found what we are looking for
and hence we have to check if software nodes are providing the same.
For example, here it's done that way:
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.14-rc1/source/kernel/irq/irqdomain.c#L178.

In all other cases it shouldn't be called explicitly.
