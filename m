I'd still say that's a bit of a hack, it's the sort of area where ACPI
just has absolutely no handling at all and so picking up the DT bindings
will work effectively although it results in something that's really not
at all idiomatic for ACPI since idiomatic DT and idiomatic ACPI don't
really look like each other and AIUI this stuff isn't getting adopted
for actual firmware (as opposed to swnodes) outside of the embedded x86
space.

The unfortunate thing is that ACPI is super limited in what systems it
models, making assumptions that only really work for fairly simple
server class systems.  Outside of that the models it's offering just
can't cope with actual hardware yet people still insist on building
those systems with ACPI system descriptions so you end up with huge
piles of platform quirks.  Audio support for modern x86 laptops is just
an endless procession of quirks :(
