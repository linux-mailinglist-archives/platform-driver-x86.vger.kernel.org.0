Hi,

the reason for this is that most hardware vendors will omit any input chec=
ks
if they think they are unnecessary. The WMI interface on my Dell notebook
does the same, sadly.

I thing the new driver(s) should be introduced in one commit. I am not sur=
e about the
new author of the commit. If the original driver was significantly altered=
, then AFAIK
you should be the new author. Still, the original author should at least b=
e mentioned
with a "Co-developed by" tag. You can then omit your "Co-developed by" tag=
.

As a site note, i recommend to use the get_maintainer.pl scripts under scr=
ipts/ to find
any additional maintainers which should be CC-ed. Since your patch series =
touches the
ideapad-laptop driver, its maintainer (Ike Panhc <ike.pan@canonical.com>) =
should also be
notified about this patch series.

You are still the author of the second patch. Also you should not send a p=
atch series as
a reply to any previous emails.

I meant that your driver should, after (!) setting up the input device and=
 event handling, call
sparse_keymap_report_event() with the code obtained from
wmidev_evaluate_method() so that userspace knows about the initial state
of the input device. You might also CC linux-input@vger.kernel.org for
the next patch series, so that the input driver maintainers can also
review your patch series.

Drivers can be instantiated multiple times, and each time their probe call=
back is invoked,
and many older WMI drivers cannot do this, so the allowlist exists.
The section "State Container" in Documentation/driver-api/driver-model/des=
ign-patterns.rst
explains how to write drivers which can be instantiated multiple times.

If your driver is not a singleton, i.e. it can safely be instantiated mult=
iple times, then
you can add its WMI GUID to the allowlist.
