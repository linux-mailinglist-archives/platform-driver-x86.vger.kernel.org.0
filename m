ACPI Feilds dump before during and after the problem

Hi,

I'm trying to implement automatic user-space platform profile controls for =
my
ThinkPad and noticed that while under load, i.e. compiling the kernel, the
firmware (I think) will start sending `ibm/hotkey LEN0268:00 00000080 00006=
032`
events non-stop, which causes thinkpad_acpi to update the platform profile.
This happens once every second. However, the profile doe's not change. This
render any userspace tool useless, since we cannot react according to Fn +
[L|M|H] events.

While this is happening, the max frequency scaling will get stuck at a maxi=
mum
of around 2990MHz (78 C). The baseline for this model, from my measurements=
, is
3.400MHz (95 C). This seems to happen only if the GPU is used and DYTC is in
MMC mode.

I can reproduce this reliably by playing a full-screen YouTube video while
compiling the kernel.

Changing platform profile to low-power and then back to performance fixes t=
his
for a while. I've also noticed that leaving the deceive sleeping for long
periods of time fixes this.

I've tried looking at the DYTC implementation but didn't find anything spec=
ial
about going into low-power, I've tried to dump the the ACPI fields using
acpi_dbg, but haven't found anything useful yet.

I've attached the dumps (in the same file), which are:

- before, taken after reboot.
- during, taken while the firmware is sending 6032 events and frequency sca=
ling
is stuck;
- after, taken after changing the platform profile to low-power and back to
performance (this was done using Fn + L then Fn + H)

Bellow, also, is the diff between during and after. But it does not show
anything useful to me.

Tested on:

- Host: 21C6000UBO
- UEFI: 0.1.30

I'm willing to help debug this in any way I can, though i'm out of ideas ri=
ght
now. I'm also not sure if this is a firmware bug and wanted a second opinion
before sinking more time into this.
