Heikki and I discussed another (possible) approach, He submitted at
some point a series [1] that adds PM domain to software nodes. In such
case the software node callbacks can handle regulator, clocks, etc
which are needed to have it work (of course in case of optional
resources, for mandatory ones we have to provide them anyway).
