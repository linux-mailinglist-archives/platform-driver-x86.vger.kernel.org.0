Ditto here. I ran out of time to build a current kernel and double check =
the ACPI status! However, I
can get the details in the next week to confirm. Apologies!

Minor nitpick.=C2=A0 The APU2 has i210 on the original boards. However, r=
ecently the shortage of intel
chipsets has led to various compromise options and some boards are coming=
 with i211 on. I'm not sure
if Pascal will standardise on these for the future though?

There is also an APU7 mentioned in the latest firmware notes. I don't own=
 one of these, nor the
schematics, but the release notes say that it's an APU3 with different et=
hernet ports. I suggest we
assume this to be true and add APU7 to our detection?

So at least with the few firmware's I have tried, the ACPI works ok on AP=
U.

The history (without full details) is something like:

- A long way back in time, we had either a different driver in the kernel=
, or the ACPI used a
different name for the LEDs and button. I forget the details without look=
ing back at some notes

- As of $lots_of_years_ago, there was a big APU firmware change and since=
 then I believe ACPI has
(reliably) offered auto configuration for the LEDs and I believe also for=
 the switch button (sorry,
hazy now without checking a real board, but I can do that no problem)

- However, I believe Enrico built the original APU kernel driver and that=
 happened to use the old
names, and then once the ACPI change happened, he feels/felt strongly tha=
t we should maintain the
current driver, disable the ACPI and ignore the updated naming convention=
 from the ACPI.

- In any case, using only ACPI doesn't setup the GPIOs for things like th=
e SIM swap chip and reset
lines, etc. So I think a platform driver of some sort is the correct way =
forward

- I think my patch from a year or so back attempted to swap the kernel na=
mes to match ACPI (need to
double check that?). This was not unreasonably resisted because it would =
break userspace relying on
the names used by the LED driver.


- The other change I tried to insert was to rename the GPIOs, more explan=
ation (some repetition from
prev email):

- All boards, except APU5 have the same basic shape and 3x mpcie connecto=
rs.

- However, although the connectors are the same, they don;t all have the =
same things wired to them

- You actually have 2x USB (with up to 2x SIM), 2x pcie, 1x msata

- So based on studying APU1 and APU2, which had a separate msata and the =
other 2 ports wired up
consistently for wifi/LTE, people named the GPIOs to match the mPCIe port=
 numbers, ie LTE Modem 1
was on mPCIe port 1, so name the gpio something like mpcie1_reset

- Then came APU3-7... These boards flipped around where modem2 was. So yo=
u now have a situation
where userspace needs to know that they should toggle pmcie2_reset on APU=
3 and mpcie3_reset on APU4,
or whatever it really is.

- So my previous attempt to sneak in a change was to rename the GPIOs to =
be something more like
"modem1_reset" and "modem2_reset" etc. This way the GPIO names stay ident=
ical across ALL boards,
even though the slots might jump around board to board. This is clearly a=
 better solution if we were
starting fresh, but it has consequences for a (very?) small number of use=
rs (I doubt many others are
even aware of the other GPIOs except for the LEDs/switch? Does even OpenW=
RT break out the sim_swap
lines and modem reset lines?)

Well, also you don't fix the problem long term. There is this jump in nam=
ing if you pick one over
the other. Plus ACPI doesn't setup the sim swap line (and it may not setu=
p the switch as people want
it? Can't recall if this is a problem?)

So whilst I agree, I think it would be desirable to narrow down the numbe=
r of permutations here

OK, so I think we see a potential solution here


Note, board summary is:

APU2-4 - vaguely the same, but modem2 jumps around slots (or disappears)

APU5 - oddball, gains an extra modem, so we now have modem1-3 GPIOs. All =
other GPIOs are maintained
(I think?).

APU6-7 - variants of APU2-4, I believe all the GPIOs stay identical?

Details:

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://pcengines.github.io/apu2-documentation/APU_mPCI=
e_capabilities/

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://pcengines.github.io/apu2-documentation/gpios/

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 However, note that the APU5 has 3x SIM swaps, one for =
each modem (each modem has 2x SIMs). APU4
on the other hand only has a single one, it just inverts how the 2x SIMs =
connect to the 2x modems


Important Note: Realise that at this point this discussion is heavily the=
oretical because many
boards don't have the reset wires setup correctly, or their functionality=
 might vary board release
to board release. eg I paid PCEngines to have mine re-enabled, because th=
ey ship them disabled by
default. Also in my testing they don't operate as expected. So it's highl=
y unlikely there is a
single user in the world actually using functionality other than "Leds", =
"mode switch", and "sim
swap" (and even sim swap GPIO is likely to be restricted number of users)=
=2E Certainly if anyone is
using any of that other functionality they they are super hacker and will=
 cope with what comes next


Conclusion: Hans, would you mind commenting on if you think this is then =
all done and satisfactory
if we reorder the GPIOs as you propose? ie you are content with the renam=
e?

So we don't lose sight of the big picture, I think the remaining detail w=
e are debating is something
like:

- kernel driver names the LEDs something like:

/sys/class/leds/apu4:green:led1
/sys/class/leds/apu4:green:led2
/sys/class/leds/apu4:green:led3

- However, ACPI gives different names (I forget the details)

- Additionally, we already broke this in the (distant) past because there=
 was a previous APU driver
which used different names still...


So I think my rejected change tried to simplify the LED names and drop th=
e apuN bit. However, I'm
really not passionate about any changes here. I have a simple wrapper scr=
ipt for the old Alix and
newer APUs which just lets me set any LEDs by number. OpenWRT is welcome =
to use this?

So keeping this on topic.

1) Have we all agreed and signed off on the GPIO changes to naming, cavea=
t we maintain the current
numbering? If so then lets tick that off

2) There is a debate about whether to change the LED userspace naming. I =
don't really want to push
this up the hill though? Proposal is to either sync with ACPI and offer a=
 back compatible flag, or
we could just keep the naming as is and allow it to continue to deviate f=
rom the ACPI naming? I'm
cool with either? (although I don't like the current naming...)

Quick show of hands from openwrt on point 2? If no one cares enough to up=
date the patch to add a
backward compatible flag then I suggest we stop that piece? (However, I'm=
 happy to do this if I can
get a little support on coding it?)


Sounds like we have made progress?

Philip, are you cool to resubmit your patch with the adjusted GPIO orderi=
ng? (and APU7 detection as
an APU3) We just then need to decide whether to drop LED renaming?

Thanks all!

Ed W
