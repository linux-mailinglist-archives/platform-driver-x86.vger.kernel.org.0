@Hans Thank you for your input.

First, here is the requested output:

Regarding the driver. Yes, it is completely refactored version that is close to
a re-write. I posted it to the IIO mailing list, since this is where the
original driver was also posted and discussed.
I realize that I made a lot of changes, but I am confident, that my code base
has a cleaner approach, since it utilizes the respective start, stop, open and
close functions of the HID LL API and contains less (if even any) unused code
and data structures. It is up to the maintainers whether they accept it,
request changes or whatnot. I've done my part and am happy using my clean and
stable implementation, that btw. is also used by other Arch Linux users with my
DKMS package in the AUR. I unsuccessfully tried to make changes to the upstream
driver during its development, which were ignored by both the devs and the
maintainers. Refactoring the driver to clean it up, make it integrate
seamlessly with the kernel APIs and providing the params to make it
configurable on devices where the manufacturers screwed up was challenging,
interesting and mostly a fun experience. Getting my work upstream, frankly, not
so much.
