My second suggestion is probably the better one.  Here it is, concretely:

The early (pre-free_efi_boot_services) code just reserves all
available sub-1M memory unconditionally, but it specially marks it as
reserved-but-available-later.  We stop allocating the trampoline page
at this stage.

In free_efi_boot_services, instead of *freeing* the sub-1M memory, we
stick it in the pile of reserved memory created in the early step.
This may involve splitting a block, kind of like the current
trampoline late allocation works.

Then, *after* free_efi_boot_services(), we run a single block of code
that lets everything that wants sub-1M code claim some.  This means
that the trampoline gets allocated and, if crashkernel wants to claim
everything else, it can.  After that, everything still unclaimed gets
freed.

Does that make sense?
