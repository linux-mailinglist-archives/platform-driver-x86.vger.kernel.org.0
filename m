I agree with checking wmi_has_guid() before calling anything across
interfaces. As far as using a bool to determine if we are in custom,
that seems to me like that would be a half measure. Since we would be
calling across interfaces anyway there is a benefit to getting the
full scope, where knowing only if we are in custom or not would just
add the ability to exit early. What I would prefer is knowing the
specific state of the hardware as it will allow me to call the
specific method ID as related to the current profile. I'll elaborate a
bit on what I mean.

Each attribute ID corresponds to a specific fan profile mode for a
specific attribute. It is used as both the data block ID in
LENOVO_CAPABILITY_DATA_01, and as the first argument when using
GetFeatureValue/SetFeatureValue on the Other Mode interface. I map
these with the lenovo_wmi_attr_id struct. The fan mode value provided
by the gamezone interface corresponds directly to the mode value in
the ID. For example, ID 0x01010100 would provide the capability data
for the CPU device (0x01), SPPT (0x01), in Quiet mode (0x01). There is
no type ID for these attributes (0x00) like there are on some
unimplemented attributes. Balanced mode is 0x02, Performance is 0x03,
Extreme mode (Which the Go doesn't use and there is no analogue for in
the kernel atm) is 0xE0, and custom mode is 0xFF. When the
GetSmartFanMode method ID is called on the gamezone interface it
returns one of these values, corresponding to the current state of the
hardware. This allows us to call GetFeatureValue for the current
profile. Currently we are always calling the custom mode method ID
(0x0101FF00) in GetFeatureValue.

If we want to avoid an additional wmi call in GZ, then grabbing it
from the platform profile and translating it back would maybe suffice.
In that case I would need to implement the
LENOVO_GAMEZONE_SMART_FAN_MODE_EVENT GUID
"D320289E-8FEA-41E0-86F9-611D83151B5F" to ensure that the profile is
updated properly when the hardware is switched profiles using the
physical buttons. This is probably a good idea anyway, but some
guidance on implementing that would be nice as I think it would be an
additional driver and then we have more cross referencing.

The simplest solution IMO would be to do something closer to what I
was doing in v1 just for current_value_show, where we instantiate the
mode variable as SMARTFAN_MODE_CUSTOM (0xFF) then check if the gz
interface is present. If it is, pass the mode variable as a pointer to
GZ where it can call GetSmartFanMode and update the value. Otherwise,
bypass that block and treat it as custom. This does add an additional
WMI call, but only when reading the current_value.
