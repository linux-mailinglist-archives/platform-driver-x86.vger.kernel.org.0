 Hi Hans,
Thank you for your efforts on the patch, I've sure learned a lot from
your comments as this
was my first contribution to Linux kernel.

Just an extra question, for the next patch I'm gonna send turbo mode support for
14 other Acer Predator laptops. The only required change is that I should add
"quirk_entry" for GPU and CPU fan count, and match product names to their quirk.

12 of these Predator laptops have exactly 1 fan for CPU and 1 fan for GPU,
but two of them have 2 fans for GPU and 1 for CPU. So my question is should
I add the quirks per product (which will end up to have 14 quirks,
same as current patch) like:

static struct quirk_entry quirk_acer_predator_ph315_53 = {
      .turbo = 1,
      .cpu_fans = 1,
      .gpu_fans = 1,
};

or should I specify the quirk per fan count like this one:

static struct quirk_entry quirk_acer_predator_gpu_fan_one_cpu_fan_one = {
      .turbo = 1,
      .cpu_fans = 1,
      .gpu_fans = 1,
};

and then set different matched DMI product names to the above quirk?

The first approach is more verbose, the second uses less code.
If possible, I would like to know your thoughts on this.

Thanks in advance,

Best,

Jafar
