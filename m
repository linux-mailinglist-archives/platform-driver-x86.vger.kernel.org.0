It seems that the encoding of the mail has been set as plain ASCII while it is
actually UTF-8.
Thunderbird is probly correctly inferring the actual encoding.
Normally git-format-patch would detect the Unicode characters and add a
matching content-type header to the patch.
But as these Unicode characters are added after format-patch has run it is now
git-send-emails task to add those headers again.

In my version of git I get the following message from git-send-email:

  The following files are 8bit, but do not declare a Content-Transfer-Encoding.
      0001-....patch
  Which 8bit encoding should I declare [UTF-8]?

As this feature seems to be really old already it should be available.
Is your "git email-patch" using "git send-email"?
Do you have "sendemail.assume8bitEncoding" set in your git config?
(It should either not be set or to UTF-8.

As this enum is part of the ABI to the firmware, the values should indeed have
explicit values.  Sorry for the noise.

Good point, disregard that comment then.

FYI I plan on sending a patch that adds the missing errorhandling next week.

I only went by the comment about "standard firmware interface" from
backlight.h.
This was mostly a pointer for you (and the pdx86 maintainers) to take a look
and decide.
