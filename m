As I understand, the dialect of ACPI used on the snapdragon laptops
is not really compatible with the subset expected by the kernel, so
you'd be more likely to run those laptops with a device tree description
of the hardware instead (if at all).

Making the driver talk to the hardware directly instead of going through
AML likely requires more refactoring.

I would ask the drivers/platform/x86 maintainers for an opinion here,
they are probably best qualified to make that decision.

I don't really mind either way, for me this is more about who is
responsible as a subsystem maintainer than whether these are
technically x86 or not.

Note that drivers that connect to the bus typically don't live in the
same subdirectory as the driver that operates the bus. E.g. the
battery driver would go into drivers/power/supply and the input
would go into drivers/input/ or drivers/hid.
