I'm not sure what you are worried about here. dell-smo8800 is
a leave driver, nothing inside the kernel depends on it being 
loaded or not. So there are no -EPROBE_DEFER complexities here,
yes -EPROBE_DEFER can become a bit hairy with complex dependency
graphs, but this is a very KISS case.

Are there any specific scenarios you are actually worried about
in this specific case?

Many modules actually have bugs in there remove paths and crash,
this is really not a common case. Sometimes users use rmmod + modprobe
surrounding suspend/resume for e.g. a wifi driver to work around
suspend/resume problems but I have never heard of this being used
for a driver like i2c-i801.

And again if users are manually meddling with this, the they can
also rmmod + modprobe dell-smo8800 after re-modprobing i2c-i801.

We are trying to get rid of acpi_driver drivers using only
platform_driver drivers for the platform_devices created for
ACPI devices / fwnodes which do not have another physical device.

Also we only want this workaround when the SMO88xx ACPI fwnode
is missing the I2cSerialBusV2 resource for the i2c_client and
conveniently the platform_device will only be created for
ACPI fwnodes without the I2cSerialBusV2 resource for proper
ACPI fwnodes which have the I2C resource an i2c_client will
be created instead. So putting the workaround in
the platform_driver automatically ensures that it only runs
when the ACPI fwnode is incomplete.

This approach does not work because i2c-i801.c registers a PCI driver,
there is no guarantee that the adapter has already been probed and
an i2c_adapter has been created before it. A PCI driver's probe()
function must not be __init and thus any code which it calls also
must not be __init.

So the majority of the smo88xx handling can not be __init.

Hans
