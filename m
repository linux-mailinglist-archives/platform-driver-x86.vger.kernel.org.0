This is not about which GPIOs are actually there, this is about what the
driver expects. Specifically about if the driver expects the clock to
be modelled with the clk framework or as a clk-en GPIO which is
a property of the driver, not of the board design.

But as already mentioned I agree with Dan and you that modelling it
through the clk framework is correct and what needs to happen here is to
patch the IPU6 sensor drivers to move them to the clk framework.

so this is all mute.

Regards,

Hans
