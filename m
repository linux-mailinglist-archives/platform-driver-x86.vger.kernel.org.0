Great, Nitin thank you for the docs!

Nitin, one question below about version checks, it would be great if you can help with
this.

Ack.

Alexander, so it looks like we need to do the following to support this properly:

1. At a new TP_HOTKEY_TABLET_USES_GTOP to the hotkey_tablet enum
2. At probe time in hotkey_init_tablet_mode add a new if / case with I guess
   the highest prio (so try before GMMS) which does:
   1. Call GTOP with parameter 0x0000, check return equals 0x0103 (or newer?)
      Nitin, how should the version check look like here, check that the
      upper byte == 0x01 and the lower byte >= 0x03 ?
   2. Call GTOP with parameter 0x0100, check return value equals 4
   3. Call GTOP with parameter 0x0200, set in_tablet_mode based on bit 0
      and bit 16. I think we should report SW_TABLET_MODE=1 when the thin-kbd
      is attached, but folded to the back
3. Make hotkey_get_tablet_mode support the new TP_HOTKEY_TABLET_USES_GTOP case and
   make it call GTOP with parameter 0x0200 and check bit 0 + bit 16
4. On the events which you identified call tpacpi_input_send_tabletsw()

And can you also check if there are events when folding the kbd behind the tablet?

Regards,

Hans
