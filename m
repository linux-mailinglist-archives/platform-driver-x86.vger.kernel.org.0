Sorry, but not fine. When a newer box is taken from storage into
production (eg. replacement or new installation), application breaks.
LED isn't the only problem, also affects buttons.

The whole reaons why I invested all the time for writing general
purpose drivers (fch-gpio is separate from board driver) and bringing
it to mainline was having clean and generic support for these boards,
instead of having to carry around special patch queues forever and
in near future just using stock distro kernel. I guess that's the
main reason for very most mainlined drivers. This will be defeated
as soon as the whole thing becomes board/bios specific again.

I purposely slept ofter the naming several times, to make sure it's
future proof and tells exactly what these leds are for. Otherwise I
could just have picked numbers and fruits.

Please don't change the names. Field relies on them.

Actually, I've already considered adding another workaround for removing
the ACPI gpio/leds. Haven't had the time for a close analysis the acpi
bytecode actually does, and what the kernel actually makes out of it.
As soon as I encounter an conflict (eg. locks the iomem from gpio-amd
fch, messes up gpio states, etc), I'll have to go that route. There
already have been bug reports in that direction (eg. simsw and reset
issues), which I could not yet reproduce (on the older bios versions).
