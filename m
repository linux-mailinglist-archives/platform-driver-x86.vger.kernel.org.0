Thank you, patches 1 and 2 look good to me now, you may add my:

Reviewed-by: Hans de Goede <hdegoede@redhat.com>

To patch 2 (since I'm co-author of patch 1 it would be a bit weird
to add it there too).

Rafael, it would be great if you pick up patches 1 and 2 for merging
into 5.11 (assuming that you agree that they are ready) then I will merge
patch 3 once 5.11-rc1 is out.

Regards,

Hans
