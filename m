I see, in this case hiding the WMI-based hwmon device would indeed be bene=
ficial to avoid problems should different userspace applications
use different hwmon devices for fan control.

Ideally this should happen inside the ACPI BIOS, but we can implement a bl=
acklist if only a limited number of device are affected.
