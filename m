I've had a bit of a think after morning coffee and I think there is 
another way to do this:

- CPU Fan = pwm1_auto_pointN_pwm + pwm1_auto_pointN_temp
- GPU Fan = pwm2_auto_pointN_pwm + pwm2_auto_pointN_temp
for example. So we're not breaking the meaning of anything or making 
things obtuse and complex.

Ending up with:
/* CPU */
// (name, function, fan, point)
static SENSOR_DEVICE_ATTR_2_RW(pwm1_auto_point1_temp, fan_curve, 1, 0);
static SENSOR_DEVICE_ATTR_2_RW(pwm1_auto_point2_temp, fan_curve, 1, 1);
static SENSOR_DEVICE_ATTR_2_RW(pwm1_auto_point3_temp, fan_curve, 1, 2);
static SENSOR_DEVICE_ATTR_2_RW(pwm1_auto_point4_temp, fan_curve, 1, 3);
static SENSOR_DEVICE_ATTR_2_RW(pwm1_auto_point5_temp, fan_curve, 1, 4);
static SENSOR_DEVICE_ATTR_2_RW(pwm1_auto_point6_temp, fan_curve, 1, 5);
static SENSOR_DEVICE_ATTR_2_RW(pwm1_auto_point7_temp, fan_curve, 1, 6);
static SENSOR_DEVICE_ATTR_2_RW(pwm1_auto_point8_temp, fan_curve, 1, 7);

static SENSOR_DEVICE_ATTR_2_RW(pwm1_auto_point1_pwm, fan_curve, 1, 0);
static SENSOR_DEVICE_ATTR_2_RW(pwm1_auto_point2_pwm, fan_curve, 1, 1);
static SENSOR_DEVICE_ATTR_2_RW(pwm1_auto_point3_pwm, fan_curve, 1, 2);
static SENSOR_DEVICE_ATTR_2_RW(pwm1_auto_point4_pwm, fan_curve, 1, 3);
static SENSOR_DEVICE_ATTR_2_RW(pwm1_auto_point5_pwm, fan_curve, 1, 4);
static SENSOR_DEVICE_ATTR_2_RW(pwm1_auto_point6_pwm, fan_curve, 1, 5);
static SENSOR_DEVICE_ATTR_2_RW(pwm1_auto_point7_pwm, fan_curve, 1, 6);
static SENSOR_DEVICE_ATTR_2_RW(pwm1_auto_point8_pwm, fan_curve, 1, 7);
/* and the same for GPU fan */

But because we still have 3 profiles to consider, I would propose that 
the settings be show/store dependant on the profile that the machine is 
in, e.g, internally show/store to correct profile via checking current 
profile number active.

I do need some suggestions on what I see as an issue though:
(1)
Given that it now becomes difficult to write all the settings at once, 
at what point should I attempt to write the "block" to the device? 
Write out for every change?
(2)
Also given the above, how do I reasonably check the user isn't trying 
to create an invalid graph? E.g, lower fan speeds for higher 
temperature? Check that a point isn't higher/lower than neighbouring 
points and expect users to write the points in reverse?

I could maybe also have pwm1_enable and pwm2_enable. Perhaps set this 
to false if a change is made, then only write out the full block if it 
is then set to enabled. Further to this, if the user changes profiles 
and the curves have been previously set and enabled, then that curve is 
written out per usual.

Looking forward to some guidance on this. I'll try making a start on 
what I've proposed above for now.
