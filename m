I would be nice when the temp <-> fanspeed relation could be passed via the thermal_trip structure. And safeguarding the hardware from userspace only works when I can restrict userspace from just selecting the preexisting "user_space" govenor.

An important role of device-drivers is also to avoid driving hardware outside
its valid specifications. E.g. charger drivers in the power_supply subsystem
have constant_charge_current and constant_charge_voltage settings which
give a max charging speed in Amperes and a max charging Voltage (typically
4.2V for single Li-xxx cell batteries).

Setting these too high can be very dangerous leading to batteries catching
fire / exploding. so naturally the drivers also have and enforce
constant_charge_current_max and constant_charge_voltage_max sysfs attributes
and the values there do not reflect the maximum what the charger-chip can
handle, but the maximum which the manufacturer has specified for the battery.

This info can e.g. come from devicetree but if not present then the values
applied by the firmware at boot should be read back and used not only
as active, but also as max values.

I believe what Werner wants is pretty much the same thing, allow userspace
to provide its own fan management, but have the kernel monitor the temperature
and if the temperature goes say above 80° Celsius, enforce a min fan-speed of
30% and at 90° enforce a fan-speed of say 70%.

Yes the exact values are a for of policy, but this is a policy to protect
hw from getting damaged and as such is fine to have in the kernel.

As for how to implement this with the thermal subsystem (which indeed looks
like it might be the way to go) I'm not familiar enough with the thermal
subsystem either.

Werner, I suggest that you send an email to the thermal subsystem maintainers
and ask them about this. It would be good to start with explaining your
problem before asking the questions. I would leave out details about the ACPI
interface. Just say you have a temp-sensor + pwm to control fan speed combination
where you want to allow userspace control while having the kernel monitor
things and have the kernel overriding userspace's fan speed setting when
things get too hot, to deal with e.g. the userspace process crashing at
a low fan speed setting.

Regards,

Hans
