Ok, that is good to know. Is there any specific reason why you are passing
"acpi_osi=!Windows 2012" on the kernel commandline?

Generally speaking passing any other kernel arguments then those used
to specify the root filesystem and things like "quiet" is not advisable.

Everything should just work without passing any special options and if things
do not work without special options then that is a bug which needs to be fixed.
