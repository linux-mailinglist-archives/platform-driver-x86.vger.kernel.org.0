We do move code and headers around whenever we find out the initial=20
placement isn't good any more, it's business as usual.

Usually when something feels off to you, it is off. But I understand=20
in these situations there's often the nagging voice telling inside one's=20
head 'Am I missing something obvious here?'; which rarely is the case ;-).=

There's no need to assume the existing code is 'perfect' (including its=20
placement). :-)
