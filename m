Hi Joshua,

In general, you don't need to wait for me to act because any commit in=20
Linus' tree during merge window will be fast-forwardable to 6.14-rc1 which=
=20
is the commit I'll be basing for-next for 6.15. So you can just pick the=20
latest commit on Linus' tree and rebase on top of it.

If there ever are some commits applied already during the merge window=20
into for-next, those would get rebased on top of rc1 once it's released.
