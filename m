Ah right, I forgot about the notify_id check in acpi_wmi_notify_handler(),
so since we have that check this should indeed not lead to wmi drivers
getting new unexpected events.

So I've now applied this patch as is:

Thank you for your patch, I've applied this patch to my review-hans 
branch:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/pdx86/platform-drivers-x86.git/log/?h=review-hans

Note it will show up in my review-hans branch once I've pushed my
local branch there, which might take a while.

Once I've run some tests on this branch the patches there will be
added to the platform-drivers-x86/for-next branch and eventually
will be included in the pdx86 pull-request to Linus for the next
merge-window.

Regards,

Hans
