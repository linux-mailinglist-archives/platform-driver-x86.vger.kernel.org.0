Yes and no. We are not repeating the functionality of the SPI driver
because we don't read nor write the flash specifically. What we do, is
we make the boot vector readable by userspace when it is not
accessible by /dev/mem. It happens to be a portion of the SPI flash
but that doesn't have to be the case because the required view upon io
memory here is CPU-centric and the rest of the system could be built
in a way that backs that memory window differently. However, this is
more or less hypothetical if you ignore some probably never-used bits
that can be set in PCH registers. As I said, effectively we are trying
to partially revert the lockdown on /dev/mem to be able to do a
harmless read on an important memory range. From that point of view we
are trying to keep functionality intact. The interface being used here
has not changed a bit since 15 years and it probably will stay that
way. In contrast to the intel-spi driver this will likely cover more
future and past systems in different use-cases with fewer lines of
code and next to no maintenance.

Oh come on,  the distros have no choice here. Either not provide a
more secure locked down system or allow a dangerous driver where
patches to make it less dangerous are not welcome. And even if the
latter could be solved, the history clearly is that it is in no way
not even remotely as reliable as the memory region my patch is
relaying to userspace.
