Some people just find the LED annoying so they just want to turn it off
I believe. Others want to repurpose it for their own purposes.

I don't believe not being able to read the status is really a big deal,
with that said it would be nice to have, but definitely a low priority item.

AFAIK once the user has overridden the value it stays at the user selected
value until a reboot or power-cycle.

Note that most thinkpads also make the power-button-led "glow" when
suspended, and we already allow overriding this.

The reason why thinkpad_acpi has the notion of safe LEDs is to disallow
overriding some LEDs in older docks which indicate when it is safe to
unplug the laptop.

In that case overriding the LEDs could be quite bad but here we just loose
"I'm suspended" notification which may be annoying if the user is waiting
for the LED to start glowing after closing the lid (and before say bagging
the laptop). But presumably a user deliberately overriding the LED knows
it is not going to glow now.

Sounds good, thanks.
