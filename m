I'm afraid v6 still has this issue. I guess this has something todo
with how you are sending the emails. I assume you are not directly
sending them from your Dell email because that leading to mangled
patches.

For now I can fix up the git author to match the s-o-b after I've
applied the patch to my tree, but it would be nice if you can
get this fixed eventually.

The usual way to deal with this is to use git send-email. There are
several howtos out there on how to use git send-email in combination
with a gmail account.

Note I'm not 100% sure if using git send-email will actually help,
I hope it is smart enough to see the gmail email address used is
not the one from the author field of the commit and then add an
extra "From: Divya Bharathi <divya.bharathi@dell.com>" header, which
git am will then use as the author when I apply the patch.

I know it will add the extra "From:"if I submit patches which
were originally by someone else, but then the author field of
the commit does not match the [user] email setting from my
config...

Anyways this is not an urgent thing to fix, I can fix things
up for now. Would be nice to get this sorted out eventually though.

Regards,

Hans
