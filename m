It's possible to boot U-Boot instead of the v5.10 kernel though. And
then it can provide an ACPI table.

Which is not a problem for ACPI. Most of that can be supported without
modifying kernel code.

More than that. There are some corner cases since DT and ACPI have
different paradigms, but ACPI is superior here. As I pointed out the
U-Boot already has support for Intel Merrifield, but won't be a big
deal to support Medfield since the critical parts are already there
(SCU, PMU, ...).

I think the fastboot is a separate stuff, the bootstub is a really
slim shim between firmware and the kernel.
