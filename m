this is the WMI event from pressing the Fn lock key.
this indicates which mode it is switching to.

this changes if the default for pressing the F[1-12] should be Function or media.
the scancodes of the Fn keys are properly transmitted, this just inverts which
ones are sent by default and which are sent when pressing the Fn+F[1-12]

In other words, there are 24 scancode the only difference is which 12 are default
and which 12 are when pressing with the Fn key
