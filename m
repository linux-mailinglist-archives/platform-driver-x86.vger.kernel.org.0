This whole situation makes me think that the code is buggy before and buggy a=
fter.

The issue here (I think) is that various pieces of code want to reserve spec=
ific pieces of otherwise-available low memory for their own nefarious uses. I=
 don=E2=80=99t know *why* crash kernel needs this, but that doesn=E2=80=99t m=
atter too much.

I propose that the right solution is to give low-memory-reserving code paths=
 two chances to do what they need: once at the very beginning and once after=
 EFI boot services are freed.

Alternatively, just reserve *all* otherwise unused sub 1M memory up front, t=
hen release it right after releasing boot services, and then invoke the spec=
ial cases exactly once.

In either case, the result is that the crashkernel mess gets unified with th=
e trampoline mess.  One way the result is called twice and needs to be more c=
areful, and the other way it=E2=80=99s called only once.

Just skipping freeing boot services seems wrong.  It doesn=E2=80=99t unmap b=
oot services, and skipping that is incorrect, I think. And it seems to resul=
t in a bogus memory map in which the system thinks that some crashkernel mem=
ory is EFI memory instead.

Let=E2=80=99s please just fix the problem instead of papering over it with m=
ore hacks.
