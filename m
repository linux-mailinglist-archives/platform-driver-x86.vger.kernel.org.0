See [1] and [2] below. Hans de Goede and Ilpo J=C3=A4rvinen signed off on u=

this way for the asus-armoury driver, as proposed by Mario. This class is t=

"most" correct one currently present in the kernel. If you think an alterna=

solution would make more sense then I would encourage you to create that
interface and submit it. In the meantime I am going to move forward with wh=

is approved, then I will adjust. Otherwise, please CC me on the patch that
changes this driver to include it.

I'm not sure what you are talking about exactly. Can you provide some sort =
of
example? The scope is quite specific as it is, and will be even more specif=
ic
once I include the requested changes. There is no ambiguity for the user on
what /sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile or /sys/class/firmware-attributes/
lenovo-wmi-gamezone/attributes/ppt_pl1_spl are. As Armin suggested and I ac=
k'd,
capdata01 and Other Method drivers will be linked as components in v2.

This is a consequence of the WMI design in the kernel as is. WMI GUID table=
s
only load on devices that implement them. If a device erroneously reports a=
n
unimplemented GUID that is a problem with the BIOS and it needs (preferred)=
 a
BIOS update and/or a DMI quirk to block it if loading it creates an issue. =
This
will be device specific.

If we run into a situation where that check passes on a device because the
interface produces a valid ACPI object that says it is supported even thoug=
h
the interface isn't fully implemented then we can quirk it. Also, this is
contradictory to your point (ii) where you insist these calls are unnecessa=

Unless you have some concrete examples of this actually occuring I'm inclin=
ed
to assume that Lenovo knows how to implement their interface. If we do find=
 a
device that has a broken CAPDATA interface, again we can quirk it.
Notwithstanding that, the data exists and it ensures that the interface isn=
't
abused to the point that hardware is pushed beyond its design limitations.
Mario or Xino can correct me here, but I expect AMD and Lenovo have an inte=
rest
in ensuring the kernel doesn't permit settings that can lead to additional
RMAs. For users who wish to disregard that there are solutions to modify th=
is
data which void the warranty, as you are well aware. I'll also point out th=
at
Lenovo controls the userspace software in Windows and never intended to sup=
port
Linux originally, so it is reasonable to assume this was just an oversight =
in
the design and they didn't expect anyone else would implement another WMI d=
river
or software when it was designed. In any case, My primary concern is that t=
he
interface is safe and reliable.

I had already planned on making this change for other reasons, but I want t=
o
dispel some misinformation you have presented here. First, I highly doubt
anyone is making enough calls to this interface that the extra 4ns are goin=
g
to even be noticed. I would say they are certainly using the interface
incorrectly if they do. Second, LENOVO_CAPABILITY_DATA_01 is a separate
interface, and it is (currently) only called once per attribute change. For
some background, this was originally added when I was permitting the curren=
t
fan profile to determine which capability data page was presented and set. =
In
the submitted version I hard code the page to custom as testing under quiet=
,
balanced, and performance showed no change. Technically it is an assumption
that this will be universally true for all Legion hardware, but the change =
was
made as the final approved version of Mario's patches which added the neces=
sary
custom profile to platform_profile explicitly states in the documentation t=
hat
"custom" mode is not user selectable. As Armin pointed out, this only appli=
es to
the legacy interface in /sys/firmware. In any case, you need not worry abou=
t
this as v2 will not need this call more than once during probe, and gamezon=
e
will not be called by Other Method ever.
