Please introduce such details when they are needed, not for a possible

Exactly. I do not see the pont of the attribute in the first place since
it just adds complexity and duplicates pwm_enable.

Without knowing those boards it may well be that a separate driver would
be appropriate, and/or that the here introduced flexibility is insufficient.
It does not make sense to introduce such complexity unless it is known
that it is needed, and that it meets the requirements of additional boards.

No. That is not the purpose of hwmon sysfs attributes.

Again, that is not known at this time. Unless there are such boards
it is impossible to predict how they are programmed, and if that
programming even remotely fits into the scheme used by this driver.
