But they *are* used to create platform devices when the PCIe device is multi-functional, which is
what intel_pmt is.

It wasn't clear in the beginning how this would evolve. MFD made sense for the PMT (platform
monitoring technology) driver. PMT has 3 related but individually enumerable devices on the same IP,
like lpss. But the same IP is now being used for other features too like SDSi. We could work on
converting this to the auxiliary bus and then covert the cell drivers.

We have some systems with 1000+ PCIe devices. Each PCIe device adds cost to HW. So increasingly
VSEC/DVSEC is used to expose features which are handled by the same micro-controller in the HW.

PMT has been shipped for over a year. It's not just a firmware change.
