I think its probably cleaner to declare an event class for those.
Currently they are using the GENERIC_UINT_EVENT class, which I intended
as mapping with string to uint, but I'm only using that in three places,
two of which are for the timeout. So dropping the GENERIC_UINT_EVENT
class is probably the best solution(?).

Yes, the idea is to generate the same output for a pointer as a normal
printk message would generate, i.e. generate a (truncated) hash of the
pointer. While the trace points should be enough on their own, I prefer
to have the output lining up with the kernel log, so that we can match
packets across both if ever necessary.

Thanks! That is a good idea.

I generally prefer to be explicit when accessing values that can be
changed concurrently by other parties. In the very least, this should
guarantee that the value will be read as a whole in one instruction and
the compiler does not do anything unexpected (like reading it in
multiple instructions, which could lead to invalid state or priority
values).

Arguably, the latter will very likely never happen even without the
READ_ONCE, but I prefer to be on the safe side.
