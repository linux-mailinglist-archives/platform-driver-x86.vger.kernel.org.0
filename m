A small note on the DMI allow-list: I don't think Z570 is the only
laptop where EC fails to disable the touchpad. While I would like this
hack to affect as few laptops as possible, I would expect that other
similar models produced in the same time period suffer from the same
issue, and I don't think we have the full list of them.
