So I looked into KDE: They use whatever Qt is doing: 
https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/blob/be91df80ef44386f98a831a5f4dfdfd4a3b6e83e/src/plugins/touchpadshortcuts/touchpadshortcuts.cpp#L41

After thinking about it a little bit: If we need to touch multiple userspace 
projects anyway, I tend to not touch the kernel at all. After all: From kernel 
side the key is mapped in a way that both X11 and Wayland can see it (given the 
right xkeyboard-config).

Thought dump below for userspace only solutions:

- Map KEY_ZENKAKUHANKAKU to XF86TouchpadToggle using xkeyboard-config

- Add Qt::ControlModifier | Qt::MetaModifier | Qt::Key_TouchpadToggle to KDE

- Possible regression: If user updates xkb without updating KDE the formerly 
working shortcut stops working

or

- Map KEY_ZENKAKUHANKAKU to Zenkaku_Hankaku using xkeyboard-config

- See if that fixes the X11 binding of KDE

- Add Control + Super + Zenkaku_Hankaku to GNOME

- If user updates xkb without updating GNOME the formerly working shortcut stops 
working

- Possible regression: I tend to the first version as there might be at least a 
change that other DEs work out of the box with it.
