It makes a lot of sense to me, it groups the members which are concerned wi=
th
keyboard backlight control. Do you have any specific issues with it? And
what would you suggest instead?

Potentially it is, but since it's an x86 platform driver, I failed to consi=
der
other architectures. Nonetheless, I will fix this in the next version.

Non-zero return value is the brightness, negative return value is an error =
code.
I realize the name `err` is arguably not be the best, but if I were to rena=
me it to
`brightness`, then the `led_classdev_register()` call would look odd in my
opinion, and I wanted to avoid introducing two variables. But I think I'll =
do
just that in the next version.
