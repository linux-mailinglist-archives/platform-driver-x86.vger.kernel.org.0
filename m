Thank you for the suggested ideas, I have found the document myself
and planned to implement this, currently i am occupied with my college
exams and will resume working on the patch as soon as possible. About
the Performance Meter (just below Delete) what you are talking about
doesn't affect this laptop, from my research only the function
`ideapad_wmi_notify` is called when that key is pressed,
`ideapad_acpi_notify` and then `ideapad_check_special_buttons` isn't.
Another thing, when the `platform_profile_cycle()` is called it
doesn't affect anything on the system except
/sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile, is this intended and gnome just
doesn't handle it or is there something wrong.
I also tried to make the mic mute LED to start working but was unable
to, do you have any ideas as to how I would achieve this. I have
dumped the acpi tables and examined them and I don't think there is a
way through that. I will research other ways when I have the time, but
do you have any ideas in the meantime?
Thanks a lot
