"...the ordering of Signed-off-by: tags should reflect the
chronological history of the patch insofar as possible, regardless of
whether the author is attributed via From: or Co-developed-by:.
Notably, the last Signed-off-by: must always be that of the developer
submitting the patch."

Okay, "must" obviously takes precedence over the "as possible".
