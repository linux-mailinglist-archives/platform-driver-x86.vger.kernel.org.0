If the data you are reading doesn't depend on any runtime variable in
ACPI tables then you can read from firmware tables as is.

You can download acpica tools and run your method on acpi dump using
acpiexec tool. Once you can take dump, you can run on any Linux system.

If you can get what you need from running on the dump, then you can do
by directly reading from /sys/firmware/acpi/tables/ from user space
without kernel change. Sometimes it is enough as lots of config data
tend to be static.

Thanks,
Srinivas
