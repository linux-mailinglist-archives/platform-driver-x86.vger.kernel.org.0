You have to test yourself before anybody else will add it.

It won't mean anything. The each register read separately may take a long t=
ime
since EC is a separate uController that may be interrupted at any time by a=
ny
higher priority task (to be sure you have to have a look into the firmware
source code). So, I'll be not surprised if 1s in some cases is not enough. =
Not
I'm against the shrtening the timeouts, but somebody should really know what
they are about and why.
