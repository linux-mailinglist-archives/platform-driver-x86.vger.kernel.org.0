If possible I would like to see some more research done on
those 2020 models too.

Specifically it would be good to get the following info:

1. Output of "ls /sys/class/backlight" with "acpi_backlight=video"
on the kernel commandline.

2. Testing of *all* the present backlight devices with "acpi_backlight=video"
on the kernel commandline. The user can test this by doing:

cd /sys/class/backlight/$backlight-name
cat max_brightness
echo $value-between-0-and-max_brightness > brightness
echo $another-value-between-0-and-max_brightness > brightness
etc.

And then see if the brightness of the screen actually changes.

3. Output of "ls /sys/class/backlight" with "acpi_backlight=native"
on the kernel commandline.

4. Testing of *all* the present backlight devices with "acpi_backlight=native"
on the kernel commandline (see 2.)

5. Output of "ls /sys/class/backlight" with "acpi_backlight=vendor"
on the kernel commandline.

6. Testing of *all* the present backlight devices with "acpi_backlight=vendor"
on the kernel commandline (see 2.)


My hope/expectation is that acpi_backlight=video will also work,
because as said using acpi_backlight=vendor is somewhat weird for
2020 / 2021 laptop models.  Also typically the acpi-video backlight
interface will have a larger max_brightness giving finer grained
(more steps) brightness control.

Regards,

Hans
