Why do you really need to define your own macro here?

What's wrong with DEVICE_ATTR_RO()?

At the very least, use __ATTR() please, to ensure you get the
read-only mode correct, but really, just use the macros we have already
today.  I see you want only one show function, so please use
__ATTR().

Same for the above, __ATTR() please.

Why not just:
	return sysfs_emit(....)
here and below?

That allows you to drop the length variable entirely.

> +

But that all is just minor tweaks, your call if you want to do that or
not.  Otherwise looks much better than originally, nice work:
