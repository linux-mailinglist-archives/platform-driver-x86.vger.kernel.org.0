On one hand, if the state changes, it makes sense to send an event. On
the other hand, there was no real key press, so we shouldn't send
KEY_TOUCHPAD_ON, a key press event. I'm not sure which of these
behaviors is standard, so it's up to you to decide.

For some reason, I don't see the OSD on resume, even if the driver
sends KEY_TOUCHPAD_ON.

The initial default was to show the sysfs attribute everywhere, not
sure why it was hidden afterwards...

BTW, I forgot to mention that I found out that there is the
conservation_mode sysfs attribute that shows on Z570, but it's a
no-op. Probably the following condition is not enough to discover this
feature reliably:

        if (acpi_has_method(handle, "GBMD") && acpi_has_method(handle, "SBM=
C"))
                priv->features.conservation_mode =3D true;
