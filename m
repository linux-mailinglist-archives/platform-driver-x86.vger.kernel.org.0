Thanks for your patch, which is now commit 4f8217d5b0ca8ace ("mfd: Intel
Platform Monitoring Technology support") in the mfd/for-mfd-next.

Does this need a "depend on X86 || COMPILE_TEST", to prevent the
question from showing up on platforms where the PMT cannot be present?

I see the TGL and ADL PCI IDs are also referenced from
drivers/platform/x86/intel_pmt_telemetry.c, which suggests this is X86-only.
Perhaps the OOBMSM is a PCI device that can be used on non-X86 platforms?
