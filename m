On the camera side, the Windows-based machines I've worked with (Skylake
and Kabylak) have data in the DSDT. There's data we can use directly,
and there's a lot that is hardcoded in the Windows driver (including
what voltage to program on the different outputs of an I2C-controlled
regulator - you get that wrong, you fry your camera). I believe Intel
provides a small set of reference designs with several options to the
OEMs, and I wouldn't be surprised if some of the data present in ACPI
that we don't know how to interpret would identify these options. I
don't think the Windows driver has DMI-based quirks, the driver isn't
machine-specific as far as I can tell.

For newer devices, ACPI should contain Windows data in a format that the
Windows team decides on its own, and data that is actually usable in the
_DSD for Linux. I've also heard that the power management would be
saner, with PM actually implemented in the DSDT. I haven't seen those
DSDT yet though.
