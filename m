ACPI can sometimes be unreliable, but that is just down to it being badly implemented by
board vendors.

If used correctly it is no more or less reliable as any other code, so its reliability is not
really a good argument not to use it unless the ACPI code on PCEngines devices is known to
be unreliable ?

Most people do no want to / don't have the skills to build their own kernel, so they are
going to be relying on a distro (including openwrt as a sort of distro) provided kernel.

That is, they don't have generic distros like Ubuntu (et al) installed on them, so the kernel and the bundled applications are all released together, typically in an monolithic image (at least that's the case for OpenWRT).

For the upstream / mainline kernel we have a very clear defined policy of
never breaking userspace (APIs). Even though these are designed for embedded
usage, some people might be running normal distro-s on these.

I have seen people run Fedora on Intel Atom x86 devices designed as
NAS boxes...

Since in OpenWRT we control both the drivers, the Kconfig settings, and the default GRUB parameters, that would work in our case.  I can't speak for pfSense, etc.

Yes a boolean module parameter with the default value of the boolean
configurable through Kconfig, so that e.g. openwrt can just pick
default values matching what it wants and won't need to specify
anything on the kernel commandline.

Note this is not just about the mapping though. From what I understand
about this, using the pcengines-apu driver conflicts with the ACPI way
of accessing the LEDs and gpios.

So for the new APU models, there should be a module-option to decide
whether for probe() to continue at all on those models or whether
it should just return -ENODEV (so the driver won't bind), leaving
things just as they were before this changes.  The purpose of this
is to keep the ACPI way of accessing the LEDs, ..., working.

That is good to know.
