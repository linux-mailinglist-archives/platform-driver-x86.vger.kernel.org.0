If you or Ard think I should, I can do a V3 with:

   Patch V3 01: Unchanged from V2
   Patch V3 02: Goes back to V1 of patch 02 that Mimi reviewed
   Patch V3 03: New. Has Andy's cleanup suggestions separated from patch 02
   Patch V3 04: This would most probably just be the V2 of patch 03 with no changes

                  -Lenny.
