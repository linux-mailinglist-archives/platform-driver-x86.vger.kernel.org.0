Getting offtopic here, but the e-privacy screen stuff is already available to userspace through /proc/acpi/ibm/lcdshadow.
What is on hold is adding userspace support for it, because we want to use the new generic API for that once it lands.

Let me know what is the best place to make this happen - from my point of view the main aim is to get this to our users to make the whole performance mode implemetnation more usable and obvious. Without my proposed patch it's really hard to tell what mode you are in on our platforms (and leads to lots of support questions).

We didn't have the knowledge or experience of the graphics driver to be able to really go and contribute effectively so for now that feature is dead even though our initial patch was fairly simple. It is still disappointing that our users don't get useful functionality (and I also have to argue with marketing as to whether we can sell Linux systems with ePrivacy screens which is

Correct.

> Is it worth me doing a simplified version of my patch (maybe using debugfs?) so I can expose the modes to users whilst we work on the common solution? I'm assuming there is no mileage in getting my patch (with the fix I owe Benjamin) in and then changing it in the future once the generic solution is available as that potentially messes up userspace too much?

Using debugfs as an intermediate solution is a good idea. debugfs interfaces have no ABI guarantees, so we can simply drop it when the generic stuff lands.

The generic solution will definitely not make the 5.10 kernel, but 5.11 is not entirely out of the question, although to be honest 5.12 seems more realistic.

Whilst I'm happy to make them part of this implementation (if they fit) I'd appreciate if they didn't get removed or held up as they're needed for our WWAN implementation which is already overdue.

As the rest of the dicussion has shown the lap_mode thingie indeed is best left in place as a
thinkpad_acpi only interface for now.

I guess the same applies to the palm_sensor stuff. We may want to advertise that through
some standardize API later, but for now we can just use a thinkpad_acpi specific API and
then also export the info through the standardized API later, as we will do for the
lcdshadow stuff.

Hans
