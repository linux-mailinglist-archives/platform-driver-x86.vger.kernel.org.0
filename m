Thanks for looping me in (I think ...)

The thing I don't like about exposing the entire SPI NOR region to
user space is that we can never take it back, given the 'never break
user space' rule. So once we ship this, the cat is out of the bag, and
somebody (which != the contributors of this code) will have to
maintain this forever.

Also, you quoted several different use cases, all of which are
currently served by exposing a chunk of PA space, and letting the user
do the interpretation. This is not how it usually works: we tend to
prefer targeted and maintainable interfaces. That woudl mean that,
e.g., fwupd can invoke some kind of syscall to get at the version
numbers it is after, and the logic that finds those numbers is in the
kernel and not in user space.

For the pen testing use case, things are likely a bit different, so I
realize this is not universally applicable, but just exposing the PA
space directly is not the solution IMO.
