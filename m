Yes, You are right. Below is a brief note on how CnQF was designed.

1)CnQF – Cool And Quiet Framework - It’s an extension of the static
slider concept wherein PMF dynamically manages system power limits and
fan policy based on system power trends.

2)OEM can opt into the feature by defining the CnQF BIOS ACPI method.

3)Static slider control and CnQF are mutually exclusive.

4)CnQF supports up to 4 modes of operation – Turbo, Performance,
Balanced and Quiet.

- It can be configured for AC and DC distinctly.
- PMF driver calculates the moving average of system power and switches
the mode of operation.
    *If system power is limited to the threshold of the current mode,
move to the next higher mode
    *If system power is not limited to the threshold of the current
mode, reduce the power budget by moving to the next lower mode.

5)CnQF feature control is through Radeon SW (a GUI based tool on Windows)

To match the behavior on Windows, we kept a sysfs node to turn on/off
the CnQF on the fly like the way it can be done the windows side with
the Radeon SW tool. If you think that having as a module param makes
more sense, I am open to make the change and send a v2.

Like I mentioned above, on Windows the static slider is absoultely dummy
when the user goes on turns on the CnQF from Radeon SW tool. Based on
the review remarks on the earlier series, we tried to
register/de-register to platform_profile, as per sysfs input (like
setting up and tearing down to platform_profile).

The Difference between Auto-mode (for thinkpads) and CnQF(for others) is
that:

- Automode gets turned on only when the slider position is set to
"balanced" in the platform_profile and
- a corresponding AMT ON event is triggered.
- it has 3 internal modes quiet, balanced, performance

But for CnQF,

- it is independent of the slider position and there are no ACPI events
for it to get kicked in.
- There are two seperate ACPI methods for AC and DC to get the
corresponding thermal values.
- it has 4 internal modes quiet, balanced, performance, turbo


There is already a WIP feature called "policy builder" where the OEMs
can build custom policies, which includes looking at the battery
percentages and making thermal optimizations accordingly. But this was
not taken into consideration while designing the CnQF on windows too. If
we bring in this change for Linux, there maybe differences in the way
the same feature behaves "differently" across OSes.

Like you mentioned the usecase, where just a compilation can end up in
battery drain if not connected to AC power. Can we not have a
documentation update saying it is advised to turn "off" CnQF when
battery % goes below a certain level? That way, the end user experiences
across Linux and Windows remains the same.

Right. The switch time would be dependent on the "time constant" values
set in the BIOS  which is configurable to the OEMs.

If we go with the above proposal it would become very identical to what
is being done with automode (expect the extra "turbo" mode and not
having a AMT event). This would need some amount of discussion with our
windows folks also to know what they think about it.

Please let me know your thoughts based on the above notes what I
provided(in the earlier section), so that we can make the code changes
accordingly.

Thanks,
