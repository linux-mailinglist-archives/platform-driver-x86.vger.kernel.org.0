My tests were conducted on top of the released 6.11.0, as suggested to me by Mario.

Yes, there is a leftover call on lid in the ACPI, however it has been there
since the very first release and it has never caused any issue.

Two notes here:
- there is no evidence, nor words from ASUS, that indicates calling CSEE twice
could be a problem, on the contrary, there is strong evidence that doing it only
once causes issues such as what I am having and/or controller returning
"every other sleep".
- This has never been a problem before and my device has been entering and
exiting s2idle just fine for the previous months.

The controller is indeed expected to disconnect upon entering s2idle and
the fact that I can wake up the device using A,B,X,Y buttons is concerning
in this regard: such behavior has never come up in past months.

Please, do so before submitting any patch that is meant to change the
s2idle path for every existing device.

This patch might have merit if you properly identify and address regressions
you introduced.

Windows does not show any sign of spurious wakeup nor aborts while entering
modern standby, therefore there is still some difference that must be
identified and addressed accordingly if this is the path to be followed
going forward.

I conducted these tests with the lastest available firmware that is
available to every user: exactly the firmware this patchset
is meant to target.

- Main Firmware: GA80100.RC71LM.318 
- Second Firmware: GA80100.RC71LS.318

On that note I want to add that the path taken for entering s2idle by
RC71L and RC72L is different as in the case of RC71L two MCUs are involved,
while with what is available to you (RC72L) only one MCU is present and
therefore you cannot assume that what works for your device also works
on the other.

Keeping the firmware updated is something users do regularly on this
device, even if it means booting to windows.

Beside, as for necessary kernel/software quirks, the new firmware is
expected to require none, at least for asus-wmi, so I ask you to leave
csee calls where they are now as in the future those will be used only
on non-updated firmware.

I also did the main testing with the previous 339 BIOS update, but
just finished confirming all regressions are still happening with the
latest available 341 BIOS update too.

If it's functionally identical there is no point in it: it cannot be merged
with these kind of regressions happening.
