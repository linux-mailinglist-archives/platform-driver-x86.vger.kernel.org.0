The latest Dell model which I have which still has a SM088xx ACPI
device is a Dell XPS 15 9550 from ~2016 this one still only has
an interrupt resource for the SMO8810 ACPI device and no 
I2cSerialBus[V2] resource.

On my Dell XPS 15 9550 the SMO8810 ACPI device is disabled,
still the accelerometer is actually there, but the IRQ is not setup
by the BIOS. So it can only work as an accelerometer and not
for /dev/freefall, likely because my model has the big battery
which covers the room for a 2.5" sata disk, so the freefall
function is disabled in the BIOS.

I have a patch series to still make the accelerometer work
on the XPS 15 9550 even though it is disabled in the BIOS,
but first lets get this series merged and then I'll send
the XPS 15 9550 series to be applied on top later.

Regards,

Hans
