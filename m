Hi all,

I don't know is this correct; but I'll reply to 2 messages, firstly to OP.

While I agree with your findings(and thanks for your effort, I also tried
to solve this but later gave up), they doesn't apply to one type of
IdeaPads (like my 520-15IKB), so I'm sure this patch won't work on me.
This is because my IdeaPad has this features:

- i8042.noaux doesn't affect touchpad, and it's connected over i2c
- There is no touchpad LED, and touchpad hotkey only sends "key pressed"
  ACPI event, doesn't do anything else
- VPCCMD_W_TOUCHPAD does nothing (also confirmed on Windows)
- Sending 1 to VPCCMD_W_TOUCHPAD on boot is not needed
- VPCCMD_R_TOUCHPAD always returns 1 (this is interesting)

So I agree on Maxim's solutions, and I have an idea on how to implement
it, I will explain it below.

Completely agreed.

I reverse engineered Lenovo Utility/Hotkeys programs of ~5 IdeaPads,
and I can say they send VPCCMD_W_TOUCHPAD unconditionally, without any
check if it's working or not. This includes 720s and 520-15IKB, which
don't have working VPCCMD_W_TOUCHPAD. This is because it's the
working-in-background touchpad helper program catches the hotkey ACPI
event (I think) and handles the situation. This can be confirmed by
killing Lenovo programs on these IdeaPads won't affect the touchpad
toggle hotkey.

I agree on we can't rely VPCCMD_R_TOUCHPAD to be 0 on boot, because
it always returns 1 for me, yet I don't have working VPCCMD_W_TOUCHPAD.

If you mean the cases when the laptop toggles touchpad itself when
touchpad hotkey is pressed. Good news is(I hope): I don't think there are
such IdeaPads, yet this still needs confirmation.

If you mean the cases where VPCCMD_W_TOUCHPAD works, I agree with you,
yet we don't know how to find/detect these IdeaPads :/

But if we can assume the IdeaPads produced before 2015 all have PS/2
touchpads (at least the ~10 DSDTs I checked all had one), and/or have
VPCCMD_W_TOUCHPAD, why don't we send both VPCCMD_W_TOUCHPAD and i8042
command when "touchpad" attr set on these IdeaPads? 
~10 pre-2015 IdeaPad DSDTs I checked all either had MSS[0-9] or PS2K
devices representing the touchpad, and I believe they were all using
PS/2 interface. Here are these IdeaPads:

S10-3 (PS2M)
S12 (PS2M)
Y530 (PS2M)
B550 (PS2M)
U510 (MSS*)
G500 (MSS*)
G570 (MSS*)
As an exception; Yoga 910(2016) has both TPD0 and PS2M, so we should
check if PS2M is present/connected I think.

So my suggestion is, if we're sure touchpad is connected over PS/2,
(it's up to you how to detect it, it can be either checking AUX on i8042
or checking MSS[0-9] and PS2K on ACPI) we can expose "touchpad" attr.

Otherwise... I say we can stop using VPCCMD_W_TOUCHPAD. I think we
have no reliable way to check if it works. Maybe we can use i2c APIs
instead to toggle touchpad instead, but I don't know if this can work/
possible at all.
Oh, or maybe we can use a whilelist for that? For the IdeaPads that have
i2c touchpads and also controllable by EC.

I think all IdeaPads with touchpad LED use PS/2 for touchpad (because
they're old), so I repeat my recommendation above.

> and EC doesn't disable the touchpad (any known models?).

I agree. I think mainly 2015+ IdeaPads fall under this category, so my
suggestion is to not expose/use VPCCMD_W_TOUCHPAD on any IdeaPads with i2c
touchpad, and send KEY_TOUCHPAD_TOGGLE instead.

Best,
Eray
