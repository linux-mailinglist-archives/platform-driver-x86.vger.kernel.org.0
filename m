So one issue as I see it is that if we were to change this then we
probably need to to change the telemetry functionality that was
recently accepted
(https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200819180255.11770-1-david.e.box@linux.intel.com/)
as well. The general idea with using the /sys/class/pmt_crashlog/
approach was to keep things consistent with how the pmt_telemetry was
being accessed. So if we change this then we end up with very
different interfaces for the two very similar pieces of functionality.
So ideally we would want to change both telemetry and crashlog to
function the same way.

Do you have any good examples of anything that has done something
similar? From what I can tell it looks like we need to clean up the
naming to drop the ".%d.auto" for the bus directory names and then
look at adding a folder to handle all of the instances of either
telemetry or crashlog, assuming we follow the reg-dummy or serial8250
model.

Similarly the crashlog and telemetry both rely on similar mechanisms
to display the MMIO region containing the data. I still need to spend
some more time looking into what is involved in switching from a char
device to a binary sysfs, but I think with the example I found earlier
of the resourceN bit from the PCI sysfs I can probably make that work
for both cases.

Thanks.
