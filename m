I had a quick look and I would say that looks quite different:

 * The EC read/write/event function uses the same command bytes, but does
   not have 0x00 0x01 between the register and the value, so
   different functions would be needed for T14s and X13s
 * Almost all event codes are different
 * The register numbers are also different

So my fears, that the ACPI functions allow more or less completely
changing the low level interface were true :(

Greetings,
