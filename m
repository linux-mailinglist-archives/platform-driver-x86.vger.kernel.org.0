fwnode, as an abstraction of ACPI and OF, is quite useful for camera
sensor drivers for instance. They need to read firmware properties (for
instance to identify whether a camera is located on the front or back of
the device, or to what port of the SoC it's connected), and being able
to do so without duplicating OF and ACPI code in drivers is useful.

swnode, on the other hand, is indeed more of a workaround for a
more-often-than-not broken ACPI implementation. It's ironic to think
that x86 ACPI-based systems, touted as being superior to ARM, are now in
a worst state than OF-based systems.
