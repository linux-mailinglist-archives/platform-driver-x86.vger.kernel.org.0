I just remembered that making thinkpad_acpi fan-control
actually requires passing a module-parameter, because as
said generally speaking leaving the fan on auto mode is best.

I wonder if that parameter was set when testing on
the X380 ?  I guess it was set since the actual
register was inspected and the changes were visible
there, right ?
