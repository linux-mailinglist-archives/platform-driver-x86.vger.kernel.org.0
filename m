Presumably it will be auto-loaded based on the WMI GUID, so even if
it has special code in probe() to exit the probe() with -ENODEV on
systems where it is not necessary due to the ACPI interface being
there, it will still get loaded.

To avoid auto-loading the WMI interface would need to be removed
from the ACPI tablets.

And probe() could still store the max fan speeds in a global +
set the boolean to indicate the max fan speeds are set before
exiting with -ENODEV in that case.

So I think you could still go this route, but simply hardcoding
for the 2 models this is necessary for seems more KISS, so IMHO
that is probably the way to go for now.

Hans
