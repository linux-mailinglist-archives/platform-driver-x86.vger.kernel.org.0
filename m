For the reference, this cumbersome solution was needed in the first
place, because Z570 has an LED, and EC toggles the LED on each
touchpad toggle button press, but EC only controls the LED, it doesn't
actually disable the touchpad. Normally, when EC doesn't disable the
touchpad, we can send KEY_TOUCHPAD_TOGGLE and leave the action to the
DE. However, as Z570 has this LED, which will get out of sync with the
touchpad state, we can't use KEY_TOUCHPAD_TOGGLE.

That leads to the following idea: if newer Lenovos have issues with
VPCCMD_R_TOUCHPAD and they don't have the touchpad LED, we can just
use KEY_TOUCHPAD_TOGGLE for them. However, if it turns out that some
Lenovo model does actually disable the touchpad in hardware, this also
needs to be taken into account.

However, this idea doesn't answer the question of how to detect such
laptops. I wonder how the Windows driver does it.

By the way, newer Lenovos also have other incompatibilities, for
example, fan modes are no longer relevant on some models, and I don't
know how to detect those either.

I need to check it, but it's entirely possible that the touchpad state
is preserved after reboot. In that case, reading VPCCMD_R_TOUCHPAD as
0 on boot would be normal. I think it's also possible that the user can
disable the touchpad before Linux starts. This approach looks problematic.

I still own my Z570, but it's located in another city. I can do some
testing on it, though. I can also provide the DSDT dump along with the
BIOS version.

Also adding Kry=C5=A1tof to this thread, who is a Lenovo Yoga 720-15ikb use=
r.

It would be perfect if someone could reverse engineer what the Windows
driver does in order to distinguish the old and the new interfaces.
With a proper detection mechanism, we could:

1. Just send KEY_TOUCHPAD_ON/OFF if EC disables the touchpad (any
known models?).

2. Disable the touchpad in the driver if the laptop has the LED and EC
doesn't disable the touchpad (Z570).

3. Just send KEY_TOUCHPAD_TOGGLE if the laptop doesn't have the LED
and EC doesn't disable the touchpad (any known models?).
