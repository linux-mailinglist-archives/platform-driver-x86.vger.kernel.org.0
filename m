Well if I did that then there are two issues I see. First is that if
there will be another PMC device in the future, we could not cope with
that because the first device that is probed will fill those cells with
its information.

Second is that if we ignore the possibility of multiple devices then we
still end up filling the module wide cells with the resources which does
not seem right to me because we have a intel_pmc_dev instance
separately.

So we can't really use the "standard" MFD way here where we have static
const cells (module wide) that we pass to the MFD core with base address
because the resources in the ACPI device (that the driver binds to) are
not organized like that. The resources are pretty much arbitrary.

OK, then my above comment hopefully explains why I can't do that.

But again we have the same issue here. So what we have is:

  - module wide resources (the cell templates)
  - per PMC instance resources created when the driver is probed against
    the ACPI device.

I don't think it is good idea to put the latter to the former because of
the reasons I exlain above.

If this would have something like single MMIO register that is split for
the child-devices this would work fine but in this case it unfortunately
does not. Well unless I'm missing something ;-)

I know but this is already existing iTCO_wdt interface that I'm using.
Not created by this patch series.

Well I think I am. It is now registered the same way as you would
register say, an input device (you don't really have drivers binding for
anything you register with input_register_device()). It even registers a
new class of devices as discussed previously.

Okay.
