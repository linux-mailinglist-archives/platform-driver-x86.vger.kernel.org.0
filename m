Hmm, ok, weird.

Usually at least something is generating events for this. Often
we have the problem that we get the brightness keys reported
by multiple input devices, this is a new problem.

Can you try adding:

wmi.debug_event=1

To your kernel commandline and then after rebooting do:

cat /proc/cmdline

To check that it really is there and then do:

dmesg -w

To monitor kernel messages and then press the brightness
up/down hotkeys and see if you get any new messages ?

Ok, good, then at least the nvidia binary driver is not
getting in the way.

Hans
