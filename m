I don't see how we can do that without a ton of work. The pgport_t is
architecture specific so we'd need to add mask functions to every
architecture for every page cache type we need to use. I don't think
that's a good idea.

I think I slightly prefer option 2 over the above.  But I'd actually
prefer callers have to think about the caching type seeing when we grew
the second user (memremap_pages()) and it was paired with
track_pfn_remap(), it was actually subtly wrong because it could create
a mapping that track_pfn_remap() disagreed with. In fact, PAGE_KERNEL
has already been specified in memremap_pages() for ages, it was just
ignored when it got to the arch_add_memory() step which is were this
issue comes from.

In my opinion, having a coder and reviewer see PAGE_KERNEL and ask if
that makes sense is a benefit. Having it hidden because we don't want
people to think about it is worse, harder to understand and results in
bugs that are more difficult to spot.

Though, we may be overthinking this: arch_add_memory() is a low level
non-exported API that's currently used in exactly two places. I don't
think there's going to be many, if any, valid new use cases coming up
for it in the future. That's more what memremap_pages() is for.
