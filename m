Nice work! Improving the hardware support for notebooks under linux is always
welcomed.

I support your initiative to upstream your driver. Having such a piece of software
upstream helps everyone.

Sounds like a good strategy to me, being able to automatically detect which features are
available is usually better than having a very long quirk list.

After looking at the driver, i would advise you to drop the acpi_driver stuff and instead
implement the whole driver as a platform_driver. Does the kernel already create a suitable
platform device with the name "SAM04[number]:[number]"?

As a general rule driver should be quiet if everything works, so unsupported features should not
result in a warning message. The other error messages should just contain the message without any
bugzilla/github links since stable kernel users might want to use the bugtrackers of their distro first.

Yes, please remove any kernel version checks.
