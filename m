void __init setup_arch(char **cmdline_p)
{
...
	efi_reserve_boot_services();
	e820__memblock_alloc_reserved_mpc_new();
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_CHECK_BIOS_CORRUPTION
        setup_bios_corruption_check();
#endif
        reserve_real_mode();                                                                                                                      

        trim_platform_memory_ranges();
        trim_low_memory_range();
...
}

After efi_reserve_boot_services(), there are several function calling to
require memory reservation under low 1M.


asmlinkage __visible void __init __no_sanitize_address start_kernel(void)                                                                         
{
...
	setup_arch(&command_line);
...
	mm_init();
		--> mem_init();
			 -->memblock_free_all();

...
#ifdef CONFIG_X86
        if (efi_enabled(EFI_RUNTIME_SERVICES))
                efi_enter_virtual_mode();
			-->efi_free_boot_services();
				-->memblock_free_late();
#endif
...
}

So from the code flow, we can see that buddy allocator is built in
mm_init() which puts all memory from memblock.memory excluding
memblock.reserved into buddy. And much later, we call
efi_free_boot_services() to release those reserved efi boot memory into
buddy too.

Are you suggesting we should do the memory reservation from low 1M
after efi_free_boot_services()? To require memory pages from buddy for
them? Please help point out my misunderstanding if have any.

With my understanding, in non-efi case, we have done the memory
reservation with memblock_reserve(), e.g
e820__memblock_alloc_reserved_mpc_new, reserve_real_mode() are calling
to do. Just efi_reserve|free_boot_services() break them when efi is
enabled. We can do them again in efi_free_boot_services() just like the
real_mode reservation does.

Thanks
