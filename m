For what it's worth, the suggested fix is the '||' underneath the
warning text:

In file included from arch/x86/kvm/mmu/tdp_iter.c:5:
arch/x86/kvm/mmu/spte.h:318:9: error: use of bitwise '|' with boolean operands [-Werror,-Wbitwise-instead-of-logical]
        return __is_bad_mt_xwr(rsvd_check, spte) |
               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                                                 ||
arch/x86/kvm/mmu/spte.h:318:9: note: cast one or both operands to int to silence this warning
1 error generated.

Perhaps that hint should also be added to the warning text, like:

In file included from arch/x86/kvm/mmu/tdp_iter.c:5:
arch/x86/kvm/mmu/spte.h:318:9: error: use of bitwise '|' with boolean operands; did you mean logical '||'? [-Werror,-Wbitwise-instead-of-logical]
        return __is_bad_mt_xwr(rsvd_check, spte) |
               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                                                 ||
arch/x86/kvm/mmu/spte.h:318:9: note: cast one or both operands to int to silence this warning
1 error generated.

It is late for me but I can push that change to the clang developers and
see what they think tomorrow if that would help?

Cheers,
Nathan
