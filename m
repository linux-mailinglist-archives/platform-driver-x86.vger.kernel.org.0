Yeah the other two messages you won't be seeing generally.  They're relevan=

certain circumstances.

The really important thing here is the kernel timestamp.  If you compare it=
 to
the failing log you have above, you can see that the failure happens a lot
later in the boot.

[    4.295441] kernel: irq 9: nobody cared (try booting with the "irqpoll"
option)

Careful optimism sounds appropriate, but fingers crossed!

As a general statement it seems that by using an encrypted partition you
exacerbated this problem because you will by definition have a longer boot =
that
you don't have access to pinctrl-amd's kernel object while getting your
passphrase entered.

I'd say if you don't hit this in the next few days with this change we shou=
ld
close it as "DOCUMENTED".  Mayyybe we should add something to the Kconfig t=
ext
to warn about this?  Not sure what else can really be done from the kernel.
