Without knowing the details because a collegue write the wmi code: The WMI 
fucntions are signigifanctly less performant then the acpi ones where it has 
measurable performance impact to the whole system when you continuously poll them.

Luckily the only wmi exclusive information (max rpm) doesn't change and only 
needs to be polled once during initialization).
