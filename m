I really prefer min_value and max_value here, those have 2 advantages:

1. min/max is used almost everywhere in the kernel/sysfs for things like this,
    upper-/lower-bound feels a bit like archaic Enlish to me.

2. The _value postfix makes it immediately clear that they are the bounds for
    the current_value attribute.

Also in case of the password sysfs inteface min/max_lenght is used, not
e.g. password_length_lower_bound. So again using min/max seems more consistent.

Sure I would be happy to have it documented that all firmware-attributes sysfs-files
are optional *except for type and current_value*. If you prefer that go for it.

If re-using the WMI names is important for you, then having a sysfs-attribute
with some standardized value to say what is what inside the authentication-sub-dir
is fine with me.

Except that I would not call it type, when thinking about authentication-types
I think about things like password / totp / hotp. Can we call the sysfs-attribute
for this "role" instead ?

But one role can still have multiple mechanisms, so for Dell in the future
we could have say:

/sys/class/firmware-attributes/dell/authentication/Admin-password
/sys/class/firmware-attributes/dell/authentication/Admin-hotp
/sys/class/firmware-attributes/dell/authentication/System-password

So although I'm fine with taking the role_name directly from WMI
(combined with a roll attribute with standardized values) I think
we still need to postfix a -password to it now, to allow room
for adding say a -hotp mechanism for the same role_name in the
future ?

(I guess this also ties into your unanswered question from above.

Ack, so as I asked above, what do you think of using "role" here instead?

I did not make that example up, Lenovo really as a scan-codes encoding for
their password authentication mechanism, see:

https://download.lenovo.com/pccbbs/mobiles_pdf/kbl-r_deploy_01.pdf

It definitely is not user-friendly.

Note when calling the Lenovo WMI functions you can specify in which encoding
(ascii or scancodes) you are providing the data and all Lenovo's examples
use the ascii encoding.  But there also is a bitfield with supported encodings
and I guess some older firmware may only support the scancodes variant?

It is all somewhat not nice, which is why I prefixed the scancodes encoding
with lenovo- to make it clear that it is non-standard.

But lets say all Lenovo models support the ascii encoding and we never expose
the scancodes bit to userspace. Even then there still is the unicode (utf8
in sysfs, utf16 at the WMI level for Dell) vs ascii issue and it would be nice
if a UI for this could give an error when the user tries to use non ascii
chars in a password for a vendor implementation...

I guess that would work (Dell not offering it). Which makes me realize that
we should specify somewhere in the doc that all sysfs files which contain
a string value, the encoding is UTF8 unless explicitly specified otherwise.
(for that specific sysfs-attribute).
