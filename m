The idea is not bad.

Why I=C2=B2C dependency? Are you expecting all problematic DSDTs to be
related to I=C2=B2C?

Can we use a predefined module name instead?

Is this same / similar to what we have in I=C2=B2C multi-instantiate
driver? Perhaps something in include/linux/platform_data/x86?

Wondering if these fields are already defined in some structure by IRQ
core or alike. In such case I would rather use more memory and
predefined structure (it it has proper naming, of course).

Okay, looking into the below, I think of better granularity of this
one, by splitting on per device module or so. Does it make sense? (I'm
expecting this one to grow too big to be suitable for everybody)

Ah, can we actually use i2c-multi-instantiate as a driver here?

...

Perhaps it makes sense to move this to the GPIO library? AFAIR I saw a
few more cases like this.

This is not needed. (Yes, now I checked it carefully)

I would prefer to see them attached to the methods and without an
additional blank line (but it's minor thingy).
