I will remove the CONFIG_DELL_PRIVACY ,because other vendors and other 
platforms maybe need to set their Mic mute led state when they enable 
soundwire and sof driver for audio function.
We can avoid hardcode in codec driver, indeed it is need for this new
soundwire & sof architecture of alsa.

It is my mistake to leave the debug line here.
will be removed in next V4 .

I will remove the CONFIG_DELL_PRIVACY for the mic mute led operation is 
not only needed for dell platforms but also other Vendors all need to 
set micmute led necessaryily.

At first, i just want to handle val0 == 1 && val1 == 1 and val0 == 0 && 
val1 == 0 only. Intel suggested i need to cover all about other cases, 
the mute led should be off if any channel of mic is on.
So i change the led state when any one channel is muted or unmuted.

Do you mean i can use a local micmute_led var in the function?
