This series looks good to me.

One question is this 5.12 material, or is this intended for 5.13
(together with drivers attaching to the newly instantiated devices) ?

I can drop this into for-next tomorrow, that gives it just about
enough "baking" time in -next to still make it into 5.12
(this should be pretty safe to push to for-next despite it being
somewhat close to the cutoff point as it is a new driver).

Maximilian, do you want me to add this series to for-next tomorrow,
or would you prefer for it to go to -next after 5.12-rc1
(and thus end up in 5.13) ?

Regards,

Hans
