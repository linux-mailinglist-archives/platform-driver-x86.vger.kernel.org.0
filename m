--- Comment #5 from Hans de Goede (jwrdegoede@fedoraproject.org) ---
Ah, ok so you indeed have "acpi_backlight=3Dvendor" on the kernel commandli=
ne,
please don't do that, the old Ideapad specific backlight interface enabled =
by
that is only for very old laptop models.

Where as your laptop is very new! If you omit this, then you should only ha=
ve
the intel_backlight under /sys/class/backlight and brightness control to e.=
g.
the slider in the GNOME system (top right) menu should work.

The brightness-keys directly changing the brightness is something from the =
same
era as the Ideapad specific backlight interface. Now a days almost without
exception the brightness keys will simply generate key-press events which a=
re
processed by userspace to actually change the brightness. This allows users=
pace
to apply various policies to the brightness setting, for e.g. interaction w=
ith
auto-brightness control on devices with an ambient-light-sensor (ALS).

Almost all "integrated" desktop environments like GNOME, KDE, XFCE, MATE, e=
tc.
will automatically do the right thing with the brightness-key events. If you
are however using e.g. i3 as window-manager then you will need to script th=
is
yourself, there are plenty of examples how to do this.

###

So as said if you omit "acpi_backlight=3Dvendor" on the kernel commandline,=
 you
should only get the intel_backlight in /sys/class/backlight, which you have
already indicated works as it should.

All that remains then is to check that key-press events are properly genera=
ted
and if they are then this is "not a kernel bug". Please install evemu or ev=
test
and then run (as root) evemu-record or evtest and test for each input-devic=
e if
it perhaps sends brightness key-press events when pressing the brightness
hotkeys.

The following devices are a good starting point to test:
"AT Translated Set 2 keyboard"
"Video Bus"

But if neither of those works then please test them all 1 by 1. Note it is
possible that the "AT Translated Set 2 keyboard" generates only EV_MSC even=
ts
or the wrong EV_KEY codes for the brightness keys (so not
KEY_BRIGHTNESS[DOWN|UP]). In this case we need to add a mapping for your la=
ptop
to fix this.
