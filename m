Short answer is that it's not absolutely necessary. With a new enough
OpenFirmware, the firmware will just construct a correct FDT.

To upgrade your machine to the new firmware, just copy 
http://dev.laptop.org/~quozl/q4e00ja.rom to a FAT partition on a USB
flash stick and run "flash u:\q4e00ja.rom" from the "ok" prompt.
Then you'll be able to run stock mainline kernels happily.

That said, it might still be useful to have a DTS file in tree (for
reference, testing, machines with older firmware, etc.). I've now re-
sent the MMP2 devicetree update patch set with the DTS file included
and copied you on that one.

As usual, I'm thankful for testing, reviews and acks.

Take care!

Lubo
