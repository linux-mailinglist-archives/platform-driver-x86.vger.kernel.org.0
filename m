Ok, seems that there is really nothing more. I run also just
decompression phase './bmfdec < /tmp/bmof | strings -el' to check.

That raw bmof binary should contain only compiled MOF code which has
corresponding 1:1 text variant, just my bmf2mof does not support
decompiling of all features and properties, specially instances yet.
There should not be anything secret. On windows system with right tool
(some WMI o WBEM browser) you should be able to view it. And moreover
access to it is available directly from userspace and no (nt kernel)
driver is required. So if vendor put there something sensitive it
already has some big problem and new vector for malware...
