I agree with this viewpoint. Also the user still sees the event when you filter out
the special keypress, since calling led_classdev_notify_brightness_hw_changed() sends a
poll notification to the led class device. So when using poll(), select(), etc. the user
can still react to this event.

Same problem with any driver which registers a acpi_battery_hook, if you unload the driver you also unload
the ACPI battery driver itself :( The reason for this seems to be that modprobe assumes that the ACPI battery
driver is a pure dependency of the first driver and can be unloaded if no other module depend on it.

I think this problem could be fixable, but i have no experience when it comes to the kernel modules infrastructure.

For now using rmmmod instead of modprobe -r should indeed do the job.

Thanks,
