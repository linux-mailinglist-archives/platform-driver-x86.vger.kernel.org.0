I'll do that with the definitions themselves.

I'll see what I can do.

So the issue is we have two authors so it is a matter of keeping track
of who is working on what.

So apparently that was in reference to the MFD driver which was
instantiating the devices using defines and there was only one spot
where they were being used. The reason why I was confused is because
the commit message had nothing to do with this patch and it I haven't
really done any work on the MFD driver myself. The link to the 'raw'
discussion can be found here:
