I think we can look at dropping the quirks in maybe a year from now
or some such. Doing it right now feels like a bit to quick after
the fw fix.

And as mentioned elsewhere in the thread, if possible it would be
good if some other driver. e.g. hid-asus could check the FW version
and log a warning if the old version is still found.

You can achieve a similar thing with only s2idle_pm callbacks and Mario's patches to export the DSM screen-off as an external symbol. Better is subjective since it still fails to fix the initial reason this work ever started - fixing the Ally - unless delays are added.

It gets worse with different compiler such as clang, or different kernel config, or even distro. The cause of issues is that a particular signal the MCU is waiting on may not occur and that becomes wildly unpredictable depending on kernel config, compiler etc.

That sounds great, once more thank you for working with Asus to
properly fix this.

> The mentioned patches achieve a similar result to using Mario's s2idle callback patches and using those in s2idle_pm_ops. But as seen above, the timing issue becomes apparent - and this is fixed only by using fixed FW.

Right. As I mentioned already in the other thread I am having second
doubts about moving the LPS0 display power off call to before devices
are suspended, doing so would mean that the display might still be on
when that call is made and that call could disable power-resources which
are necessary for the display causing issues when the display driver's
suspend method runs.

So I think that we need something closer to Mario's original POC from:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/superm1/linux.git/log/?h=superm1/dsm-screen-on-off

if we want to make the suspend order more like Windows and make
the LPS0 display off call when the last display is turned off.

And as you have explained making the suspend order more like Windows
is unrelated to the real cause for the ROG Ally MCU suspend issue,
so lets continue any discussion about suspend ordering in the other
thread.

Regards,

Hans
