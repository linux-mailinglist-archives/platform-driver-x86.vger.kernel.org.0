There are basically 4 possible scenarios and to me it
is only clear from this thread what will happen in 3 of
the 4 scenarios :

1. Old TA fw, Old kernel (TA_OUTPUT_RESERVED_MEM=906) -> works
2. New TA fw, Old kernel (TA_OUTPUT_RESERVED_MEM=906) -> broken
3. Old TA fw, new kernel (TA_OUTPUT_RESERVED_MEM=922) -> ???
4. New TA fw, new kernel (TA_OUTPUT_RESERVED_MEM=922) -> works

If the answer to 3 is: "works" then I agree that this patch
should be submitted to Linus as a fix with Cc: stable ASAP
and then once that has hit most stable series it should be
ok to upgrade the fw in linux-firmware

Note this is still not ideal but IMHO it would be ok.

But if the answer is "broken" then we will really need to
find some way to unbreak this, which could be as simple
as querying the fw-version and basing the size on this,
but having a kernel change which will regress things for
users who do not have the old firmware yet is simply
not acceptable.

Regards,

Hans
