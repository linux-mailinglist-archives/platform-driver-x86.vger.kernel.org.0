Ok, so you have just these bios scan codes in your DMI table, but you do
not know what they means nor if you can trigger them somehow.

You should include this information into commit message.

It is possible that your particular laptop model does not have
physically keys which can trigger these codes... (Just guessing)

This was question for Mario as he is probably the only person who can
bring some light to this area.
