We can put it one level up to be a sibling to value / pointer unions.
In that case is_array can be anything (we just don't care).

Actually strings aren't inlined.

swnode.c. I meant property_{get,set}_pointer().

Thus, moving to upper layer makes more sense. Right?

Nope, since strings are not inlined AFAICS.
