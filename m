Is there a specific reason why this series is RFC?  Typically that
indicates the code is not yet ready for merging and normally the
cover-letter indicates why the series is RFC.

The hardware this is for is pretty specialized, so I'm mostly just going
to trust that you know what you are doing here.

I see that this has not been reviewed by any of the other Melanox people,
it would be could if you could get someone else from your time to review
this series and give there Reviewed-by once they are happy with it.

Regards,

Hans
