PCI_VSEC_ID_INTEL_TBT is not mentioned at all in the USB4 spec,
hence there's no connection between "is_thunderbolt" and the USB4 spec.

It's a proprietary VSEC used by Intel and the only way to recognize
pre-USB4 Thunderbolt devices that I know of.  Its ID is also
different from the DVSEC IDs given in the above-mentioned spec.
