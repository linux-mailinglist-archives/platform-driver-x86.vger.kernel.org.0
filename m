Unless the information is available in ACPI properties that the CIO2
bridge driver can access (and I wouldn't be surprised if it was the case
in some way, there's are different IDs that we're not sure how to use,
the Windows driver may very well map them to a set of reference
designs), then a DMI match is likely the best option.
