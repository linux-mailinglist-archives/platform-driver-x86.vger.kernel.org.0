Ah I see, this not being tested on real hw is a good reason for the
series to be a RFC series :)

So my main concern here would be any new userspace API being added.

AFAICT from quickly scanning all 8 patches all new userspace API
is sysfs based and it is being documented/specified in patches 3 + 8,
so I will reply to those separately.

Please let me know if I've missed any other new userspace API bits.

I'm less worried about the API's between various kernel parts since
we can always refactor those later.

Regards,

Hans
