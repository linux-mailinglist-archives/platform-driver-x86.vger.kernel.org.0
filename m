Thank you for your patch, I've applied this patch to my fixes
branch:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/pdx86/platform-drivers-x86.git/log/?h=fixes

Note it will show up in my fixes branch once I've pushed my
local branch there, which might take a while.

I will include this patch in my next fixes pull-req to Linus
for the current kernel development cycle.

Regards,

Hans
