Ok, so this is duplicating the information from /sys/class/power_supply .

Is there a reason why your userspace app cannot just directly get
these values from /sys/class/power_supply ?

I guess it might be convenient to have this all in the same ioctl,
I understand that the PMF code already needs to retrieve it regardless.

Maybe just have an ioctl which just memcpy-s the entire
ta_pmf_condition_info struct to userspace?  I think that is already
part of the kernel <-> PMF-firmware API so making that struct uAPI
should be fine since it is already something which cannot be changed
because it is also firmware API ?

It seems just being able to copy the cached ev_info the driver
already has to userspace is better then defining a new struct with
similar fields and needing to manually copy over everything field
by field ?

And then instead of an ioctl it could even just be a binary sysfs
file, avoiding the need to add a somewhat random new chardev
to /dev  ?

Regards,

Hans
