Hi Armin, would it work to add the second GUID to the existing
wmi_driver wmi_device_id array? Then I could save the wmi_device in
the driver data on probe. Later when I get the notification on the
other GUID I would just call wmidev_evaluate_method on the saved
pointer out of the private data.

I would just need a way to distinguish the two wmi_device structs.
Seems like the notifier setup wouldn't be needed and it could stay as
one module for one feature.

I have the code ready to mail a v2 patch series with the remove
function added and the fixed method id and the input triggering on
probe, but still using wmi_evaluate_method. Without having much kernel
experience, I sort of agree with Hans that it would be best to be
simpler and not have two modules for one feature, the notifier setup
looks somewhat involved. However if we can do something like the above
idea, that doesn't seem to make it much more complicated to avoid the
deprecated API and I can mail that out instead.

So let me know what you think.

Would it not work to convert this driver to the WMI bus model now? I
wasn't able to find anything about this bus model code.

If I'm understanding
Documentation/driver-api/driver-model/design-patterns.rst correctly
then I think this driver would be okay to have the same GUID probed
multiple times. Each device would get its own private data allocated
for it and that would be cleaned up which each device is removed.
Although, it does look like you would get double input events. I'm not
sure if that's the correct behavior without access to a machine with
two of these switch devices to test on.
