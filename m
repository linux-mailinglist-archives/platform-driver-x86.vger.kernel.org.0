Nice, so AFAICT the old 5.10 kernel is hidden/abstracted away in pettit
boot and the user just sees a bootloader-binary + mainline kernels.

Interesting approach :)

Ok, the amount of patches there does not look to bad. Although there
are some patches which will need some work before they can be mainlined
(e.g. the IRQ handling patches).

So what is the long term end goal here. Do you want to get everything
supported in mainline (sounds feasible to me), or are you just trying
to reduce your delta to mainline so rebasing is easier ?

I guess that for either goal you will want this patch merged and
it is just a single line, so I'll go and merge this patch now.

If you want to get as much in mainline as possible, I think it would
be good to try and get the gma500 changes merged. That seems to be
the biggest change when talking about lines of code. So if you get
that in place then for discussions surrounding further patches you
can say that your branch for this is just a couple of 100-s of lines
code away from mainline and you would like to get those last 100-s
of lines in mainline :)

Regards,

Hans
