--- Comment #111 from Eugene Shalygin (eugene.shalygin@gmail.com) ---
Most of these boards, as you probably know already, seem to not provide
readings for all the available sensors via the Nuvoton chip. For example, w=
ater
temperature sensors are unavailable. Readings from those sensors are availa=
ble
via the embedded controller registers. Thus I created a little HWMON driver=
 [1]
to read them using WMI method 'BREC' (probably stands for Block Read Embedd=
ed
Controller). The driver currently supports only three boards (ROG Crosshair
VIII Hero, ROG Crosshair VIII Dark Hero, ROG STRIX X570-E GAMING). ROG
Crosshair VIII Formula should not differ, but need someone with the hardwar=
e to
test.

While working on these sensors for the Libre Hardware Monitor project, we f=
ound
that the Nuvoton 6798D chip provides sensors readings for configured in the
BIOS QFan sources in its registers [2]. Maybe those are worth displaying wi=
th
the nct6775 driver? They can include sensors that are otherwise are availab=
le
from the embedded controller only.

If you want to add support for your boards, feel free to submit patches to
either project (and notify me to update the driver for HWMON from LHM if
needed, please).
