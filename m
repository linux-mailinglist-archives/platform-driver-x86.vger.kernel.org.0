Thanks for taking care of these! It's really great that you spent the
time to do this series. I'm already thinking about what we can add
after these are in. I think support for re-configuration, so support
for changing the pin-configuration in runtime is going to be needed
soon after these. But first things first (sorry, I'm getting ahead of
myself).


thanks,
