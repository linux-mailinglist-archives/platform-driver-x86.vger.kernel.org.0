I'm fine with this being merged as an interim fix once Andy's comments
have been addressed. Weifeng, in that case you can then also add

Reviewed-by: Maximilian Luz <luzmaximilian@gmail.com>

However, I too would like to see this fixed properly on the serdev side.

I will be away for the remainder of the month starting end of next week,
but I could try to look into this after that, provided no one else did by
then.
