I'm struggling to see how it fits the tweaking CPU vs GPU vs system - do we end up introducing multiple sliders - which gets complicated with all the choices? I'm just not convinced yet.

So one thing to keep in mind here is that this is the kernel <-> userspace
API. It certainly is not the intention for a UI to show this 0-100 scale
to end-users. The most raw version of a UI should display the number
of actually supported levels given by the mappings file, preferably with
the labels from the mappings file visible.

So the idea behind the 0-100 scale, is that lets sat that
we have 2 laptops, which each 4 profiles:

1. Game laptop:    Low power, Balanced, Performance, Ultra Performance
2. Ultra-portable: Ultra Low Power, Low Power, Balanced, Performance

And we have a UI which offers a balanced option, then to configure
the balanced option on laptop 1. we would need to select profile 1 (of 0-3)
and on laptop 2. we would need to select profile 2 (of 0-3)

The idea behind the 0-100 scale is that in that case both would map
there balanced profile to 50 and userspace can just write 50.

Note I'm not 100% sold on this idea myself yet.

> I'm also not sure about being able to tweak everything too - Linux users are smart but is it just getting irritating at that point? Power (hah!) users have plenty of tweaking tools at their disposal if they want to get into change p-states and tweak every little power option; but this exercise is aimed at those who want to make simple general changes - increase the power because they have a build to complete, drop into quiet mode when watching a movie, or a low power setting when they know they're not going to be able to charge for a long time. I suspect some smart person will end up

Well for power-users to be able to tweak, the kernel API
needs to expose all the support profiles. Before the 0-100
idea, the idea for the user space API was to use strings
and just support "low-power", "balanced" and "performance" +
optional extra profiles where the extra profiles where
sort of a free-for-all wrt names, etc.

 From a UI perspective this might very well work, but chances are
that for GPU performance we would need to:

a) Tell the EC to go for maximum cooling / aggressive ramp up the fans
b) Tell the CPU (e.g. pstate, TPD) to go for a balanced profile
c) Tell the GPU, (e.g. the nouveau or radeon drivers) to aggressively
turbo and maybe if it has a configurable TPD give it some more TPD

And we very likely need to talk to multiple drivers for this,
at least some firmware driver and the GPU driver.

Which is where my type attribute idea comes from. I know that for this
discussion started with controlling firmware (DPTF oem vars / EC)
performance-profile settings, but at some point we probably also need
to e.g. bring in controlling GPU turbo performance profiles.

Well this looks a lot like what we started with and I think it is also
closer to what Bastien would prefer as an userspace API for this.

So I guess that would bring us full circle to the initial proposal
where we have a bunch of strings describing profiles, but too avoid
a free-for-all we pre-define a bunch of standard profile names and
we say in the specification that where-ever possible drivers should
map there avaivable profiles to the pre-defined profile names ?

Bastien, have I understood you right that having a list of
pre-defined profile-names and then using strings for the sysfs
API would be your preferred API for this ?

I do still think we should probably add a "type" attribute, which
for thinkpad_acpi and for hp-wmi would probably just be hardcoded
to "system".

I think that having the notion of a separate performance profile for at
least the GPU makes sense, not because of that is the UI which we want
to show to end users, but because the GPU's turbo behavior will likely
be controlled by a completely different driver. AFAIK currently different
GPU drivers have different knobs for this, preparing the
performance-profile API to allow the drivers to offer a unified
(and probably dumbed down a bit) API for this is something which we
should at least keep in mind.

I guess that for GPU drivers we could also have a "custom"
performance-profile, so when users use advanced vendor/driver specific
tools to tweak the GPU performance, then reading back the currently
selected profile would report custom; and writing one of the default
profiles would override the users/tools tweaks and go back to the
settings belonging to that profile.

Anyways adding a "type" sysfs attribute will allow us to also use
the performance-profile API for e.g. GPUs later, we can also even
define only 1 valid value for it for now ("system"). This way we
can document that tools interacting with the API should at least
check the type and skip performance-profiles with a type they do
not know.

Bastien, any comments on the concept of having a type sysfs attribute?

Regards,

Hans
