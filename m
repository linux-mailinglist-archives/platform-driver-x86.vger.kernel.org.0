The dell_wmi: firmware scancode XXXX maps to unrecognized keycode XXXX
events are emitted at startup when processing DMI table entries that dell-wmi
does not recognize.

my DMI table contains among others:
48 00 FF FF 
50 00 FF FF

the scan/keycodes are 2 bytes the array was only 1 byte until now as there were
never any reported keycodes with the higher byte set.


unlike my other patches this one is not for key press events. None of the keys on my laptop correspond to these scancode/keycode.

the reason for this type of log event is in a comment:

/*
 * Log if we find an entry in the DMI table that we don't
 * understand.  If this happens, we should figure out what
 * the entry means and add it to bios_to_linux_keycode.
 */

therefore I tried adding this to the list of known keycodes.
As of now almost half of the keycodes in the list are KEY_UNKNOWN.

If anyone has a way of figuring out how to map this to a specific key,
i will try to identify it further.

I agree with this. The only reason i am adding these definitions is to get rid of 
annoying log messages. They should really be debug.
