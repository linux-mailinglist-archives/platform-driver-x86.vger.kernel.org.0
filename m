Hi Ilpo,

the delay in replying.

I can reduce the logging going from pr_info to pr_debug or just remove 
it
as a whole for sure. But as I thought that this is an end-user thing 
(given it
is a ThinkPad) I put it there on purpose to let the user know what was 
going
on. The message about the de-facto suppressed sensors just logs once per
provided sensor index on sysfs creation, not the sensor's usage. The
thinkpad_acpi module, moreover, logs excessively in general already. 
Just saw
this from a user's perspective seeing myself google forum posts for 
missing
sensors without a trace. I can surely make the logging conditional in
thinkpad_acpi_init_banner().

That user-thinking was also part my second thought: as I didn't find any 
such
problem for a P15 on Google or the like I suspected this to be a 
not-so-usual case. Thus,
I have already re-worked the patch to its current form using a parameter
instead of using a quirk-table (analog to the ones already in place) 
that I had
written initially (using BIOS revision N30) as this would mean
suppressing the sensor on any such device without knowing if the problem
_really_ exists on the device in general in the real world - I haven't 
found any such
report on the Net while searching for it so I _assume_ that this is a 
weird
edge-case we're talking about here that the sensor is non-functional or 
my
hardware is borked in some way for whatever reason. The rather static 
creation
of let's say 8 or 16 sensors in general _could_ probably be the problem. 
The code
seems to make 16 iterations on my device as I saw when I had debug log 
in place,
probably due to the static size of TPACPI_MAX_THERMAL_SENSORS;

Also I imagine there will be other ThinkPad-devices/models having such
problem with a different sensor index (which I surely don't
know of yet) so these would not be listed in the new quirk-table and 
needed a new
patch to include them valid for this quirk. It might be another model 
needs a
quirk for sensor 14, 15 and 16 which the current code would just create 
if the
device falls through a specific match (not validating the actual 
sensors) as the
sensors creation currently is rather "static". Using the parameter a 
user would be
able to just add the index of the broken sensor and would be good to go 
no
matter what model being used and what sensors indices it would affect - 
it's just
my approach to be generic and future proof. The quirk-table approach 
also used
more code than the parameter approach with even reduced flexibility.

As I understand your mail you would also eventually like testing the 
sensor
being created for let's say "technical validity". On my machine 
temp4_input is
technically valid (sysfs created and working) but spills a static 0. So 
this
sensor is actually unusable from a user-point of view making me exclude 
it via
the new parameter as well. What would (in your opinion) the handling be 
for
this specific sensor temp4_input be when using the quirk-table approach?

Please advice on how to re-write the functionality so I can give it 
another spin.
Sorry for the lengthy explanation and thanks for your time reading this.
