Discharging your battery till the hardware shuts itself off should never
harm the battery, the battery-management-controller will turn off all
power (simulating removing the battery) before the battery discharges
to a level where it can be damaged.  So unless there is some very bad
bug in the hw of your laptop this should be safe to do. Otherwise
the OS hanging while the battery is already low and you are not
present to detect this could also damage the hardware.

With recent Linux distributions you need to disable the upower daemon
(you probably need to mask it in systemd to avoid it being autostarted)
to avoid the auto-shutdown.

Note I completely understand if you still do not want to do this,
I'm just saying that it is not *that* dangerous.

Regards,

Hans
