Yes and no, I meant this to be read as "does not (...) report correct values"
but your suggestion is better I will fix this for v2.

Until recently userspace pretty much ignored SW_TABLET_MODE, so reporting
it while it did not work was not a big deal, but as I tried to explain
in the commit message always reporting SW_TABLET_MODE=0 does cause some
real issues:

>> 1.  When SW_TABLET_MODE is reported and is reporting 0:
>> 1.1 Disable accelerometer-based screen auto-rotation
>> 1.2 Disable automatically showing the on-screen keyboard when a
>>     text-input field is focussed

By defaulting to not reporting SW_TABLET_MODE at all we go back to the
(slightly) older userspace behavior of always doing auto-rotation and
always popping up the onscreen-keyboard on text-field focus (on devices
with a touchscreen).

So basically the bad side-effects of reporting SW_TABLET_MODE while it
is not working are much worse then the bad side-effects of not reporting
it on devices where it does work.

More in general the way userspace uses SW_TABLET_MODE means that if
we report it, then it MUST be reliable. If it is not reliable then it
is better to not support it at all.

For this reason the intel-vbtn, intel-hid and asus-wmi driver have all
3 already been moved over to using a DMI based whitelist. And now I
guess it is hp-wmi's turn to follow in their footsteps.

Ideally there is some WMI query other then the HPWMI_HARDWARE_QUERY
which actually tells us which bits in the HPWMI_HARDWARE_QUERY result
are valid and which bits are simply always 0.  I hope someone who
actually has this hardware can spend some time figuring this out.

In the mean time disabling SW_TABLET_MODE reporting is the safe
fallback option; and if people come forward where this does work
then we can do a DMI based whitelist (*).

Regards,

Hans

*) Which will hopefully be a temporary solution but there is absolutely 
no documentation for all this crap and most vendors don't seem to care
about helping us with this, so...
