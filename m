Yes. Out-of-the-box it's a "modern standby" laptop. There's a "hidden"
bios menu with extra settings that apparently allows to select legacy S3.
I did not change it, so I'm testing the "modern" mode.

Note that this driver fetches SMU version from MMIO, which looks odd to me:
elsewhere (i.e. in the amdgpu driver) SMU version is retrieved by issuing
the corresponding SMU command, as far as I can tell.
