We have a platform profile which is also quite vendor specific,
nevertheless we (as upstream) are trying to have points of
unifications.

I think this driver should be part of the corresponding profile /
network subsystem part and be a one (of the) hardware implementation.
Somebody can add more. Users in Linux should have a common ABI for
that. And I'm not sure it should not be a netlink based one.

I believe its source is a Windows driver and Windows "culture", they
simply don't give a crap about anything else and Windows is a
product-oriented platform (each product is unique even if 99.9% of the
hardware and firmware is the same with twenty more products).
