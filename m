Ah, I did not know that; and that is typically info which I would
have expected to be explicitly mentioned in the non-existing cover-letter
for this patch.

Yes I could merge rc4 into my for-next, but I'm not really a big fan
of back-merges like this. I try to keep my for-next history linear
based on the last rc1, because I find seeing what is going on
a lot easier that way. But if this happens more often I guess
I may need to get used to doing back-merges more often then
just after rc1 is out.

What I don't understand is why this patch was not send as a part of
the series starting which also had the
"7beade0dd41d x86/cpu: Add several Intel server CPU model numbers"
patch. That patch just adds a couple #define-s presumably there
were more patches in that series actually using those defines.

Things would have been cleaner / easier if this patch had simply
been a part of that series and if it was merged in one go with
that series...

Btw this new CPU ID is also missing from:
drivers/platform/x86/intel/pmc/core.c
drivers/platform/x86/intel/ifs/core.c

At least I assume it will need to be added there too, although
I guess it might not be as simple as only adding the CPU-id
match there ?

If you can do that, that would be great, thank you.

Yes.

Hans
