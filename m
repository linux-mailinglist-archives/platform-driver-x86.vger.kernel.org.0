It's for trying to keep it in deepest state for more of the kernel's suspend
cycle when it has been interrupted. If you're already in the deepest state =
for
most of the suspend cycle it won't do anything.

This is the BIOS component with the bug.  The fix is in 64.66.0.

Windows does Modern Standby a little bit differently.

I can't put words in their mouths on what it means for them.

I'm not their customer; you are.

Yes

That amount of time in deep sleep matches how it should be behaving.  If th=
at
*wasn't* with acpi.ec_no_wakeup=3D1 then the usleep_range() change is helpi=
ng and
I should clean up and send a patch for it too.

But to your question, I don't have insight into the exact nature of what HP=
's
EC does; so I hypothesize.  I only know the AMD side of it.

OK.
