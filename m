You say that this will not happen, but the problem which I have with the
OpRegion API is that this may actually very well happen. There are no
guarantees of this not happening. We are relying on the AML code from
the BIOS adding the "Serialized" attribute to all functions accessing the
OpRegion, all that is necessary is one bug in the AML code and then this
will happen.

And it is typically very hard to get vendors to issue BIOS updates to fix
things like this :|

I must honestly say that I find the whole design of the OpRegion API
lacking. There are other options to interface AML code, like e.g. modelling
the ISHTP as a generic serial bus, then a single OpRegion access can do the
following:

1. AML fills a buffer
2. OpRegion call processes buffer and writes back results (status code +
   data read if it is a read) to buffer
3. AML processes buffer

This is e.g. used in some Microsoft Surface 3 devices, see:
drivers/platform/surface/surface3_power.c

This would make the calls more-or-less atomic, removing the need for the
ACPI Methods to all be Serialized.

This would also allow the Opregion to return an error status code when
the EClite is not ready, instead of unregistering + reregistering the
OpRegion, which in itself is another source of possible races (see below).

I assume that it is too late to change the OpRegion API now, so that
we are stuck with this ?

I must say I'm disappointed about the quality of the OpRegion API design
here. APIs should be designed so that it is easy / natural to use them in
a correct way, where as this API seems to be dessgned in such a way that
it is easy to use it the wrong way.

I really expect Intel to do better the next time the introduce a new
OpRegion for something. It would help greatly if Intel would send some
rough sketches of how the API is going to look like to the mailinglist,
so that we can actually correct issues like these, rather then the API
already being set in stone and that we end up having to live with a
not so good API.

I understand that the intention is for all the ACPI calls to be serialized, but
nothing is guaranteeing this. All it requires is one method not being marked as
serialized...

I don't want the kernel to read / write beyond the end of kernel-owned memory
because the following happens (this assumes one AML method is missing the Serialized
attribute):

1. #define ECL_DATA_OPR_BUFLEN	384
2. Thread A sets offset to 0
3. Thread A sets len to 100
4. Thread A writes ECL_ISH_WRITE
5. Thread A kernel checks (offset + len) < ECL_DATA_OPR_BUFLEN, this is ok
6. Thread B sets offset to 300
7. Thread A kernel does memcpy(message.payload, opr_dev->opr_context.data_area.data + message.header.offset, message.header.data_len);

7. Will now end up reading 100 bytes from offset 300 of opr_context.data_area.data,
which is only 384 bytes big, which needless to say is not good.
I see now that the offset + len are copied into message.header and then the copied
values are used. It is tempting to think that this thus can be fixed by doing a
check on the copied values, but the message struct is a local variable, so the
compiler will alias the 2 values and might decide to do the check on the originals;
and the compiler is also free to re-order things. So this making of a local copy
does not help.

This is a classic time-of-check vs time-of-use problem. Since we cannot _guarantee_
that all users of the OpRegion are properly using the ACPI Serialized Method attribute,
we need some other mechanism to ensure that len + offset do not change between
checking and consuming them. The most straight forward solution here is to
protect opr_context with a mutex so that it cannot be changed by another thread
while one call is in progress. Since all accesses should be serialized at the AML
level anyways this will not add extra serialization, while it will help avoid
AML bugs turning into out-of-bounds memory accesses inside the kernel.

I see; and since the OpRegion API does not allow returning a status code to
communicate the link-not-ready thing you need to do this unregister + re-register
dance instead. See this is what I meant above when I wrote that the whole OpRegion
API seems lacking. This could all have been solved by having the OpRegion calls
communicate back a status code.

Now you are relying on communicating the availability of the link by calling
_REG instead. This means that we better hope that all users of the OpRegion will
correctly check the flag set by _REG, which in my experience with a lot of AML
code is something which is often forgotten, so this will be another source
of DSDT/AML bugs for AML code using this OpRegion <sigh>.

Also note that this is racy too, on suspend we unregister the OpRegion, calling
_REG in the process. But _REG methods typically are not Serialized so now the
following may happen:

1. Thread A is executing a function using the EClite OpRegion
2. Thread A checks the flag set by _REG, sees the region is available
3. Thread B is executing suspend for the EClite device, unregister the
   OpRegion, calling _REG to clear the flag
4. Thread A continues with actually accessing the no longer available
   OPRegion leading to an error because there is no Opregion handler
   registered.

So this means that _REG should be marked Serialized for this device,
I wonder if it actually is marked as such in the DSDT of your test hardware ?

I think we might get away with this regardless because 3 probably takes a
rw-lock on the ACPI namespace which it can only get if no other threads
are executing any AML code (I'm speculating here I did not check), but this
is yet another example about how this entire approach is less then ideal.

I don't see a problem, but I don't think that the ishtp_get_device() here
and the 2 ishtp_put_device() calls below are necessary.

This is the probe function for a ishtp_cl_driver as long as that driver
is bound to the cl_device (which gets passed as parameter to the probe())
the cl_device can never go away, not until the matching remove function
from the ishtp_cl_driver has been called, so the get at probe + the put
at remove are not necessary, since the cl_device already must stick
around for as long as the driver is bound.

Another way of looking at this is that the linux device-model/driver core
already does a get when it binds a driver to the device (and a put on
remove).

Ok, so I guess we need to live with the ugly deregister + re-register
OpRegion dance for the devices where the PSE is shutdown during suspend.

You also write: "sometimes PSE is always-on", what about that case,
I assume in this case there will be no reset after resume? So then
unregistering the OpRegion handler at suspend (and setting link_ready=false)
will be wrong since without the reset the OpRegion handler will never
get reinstalled ?
