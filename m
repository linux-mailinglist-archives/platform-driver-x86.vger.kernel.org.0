I see your point, fine with me!

There is strreplace() in use somewhere still which is what I suggested.
It might be that I missed the fact that in some places the change
happens to the ''\0' rather than another non-NUL character.

So, strreplace() is basically for changing '$a' to '$b' where neither
of them is NUL.

Otherwise we have
 - strsep()
 - strchrnul()
 - strtrim()

depending on the case.

Sorry if I was not completely clear about something.

I see your point, thanks for elaboration.
