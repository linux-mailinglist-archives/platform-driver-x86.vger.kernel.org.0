Hmmmm.
I'd like to get a fix in so anybody updating to 6.13 don't get hit (the Fedora users will be getting it soon and Arch users are likely seeing it already).

I think I'll do a fix tomorrow using the non devm_ version as that's safest; and then take a bit more time with implementing a probe with the appropriate pieces.

Thanks again
Mark
