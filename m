Yup, I'm aware of that :)

I will.

Yes they are but I mean that when we fill those resources we change the
static struct mfd_cell contents. Now when the driver is unbound from
sysfs that stuff is left in the structure (as the module is not
unloaded). Probably not an issue anyway since next bind it will be
overwritten (or alternatively I'll just take a copy of that stuff).

Well, by "library" I mean that the SCU IPC itself does not bind to
anything but instead it gets called by different drivers such as this
one passing the device pointer that is the SCU IPC device. Here for
example it is the platfrom device created from an ACPI description.
