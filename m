This comment was meant for use of /dev/cpu/X/msr not msr_index.
I didn't want to bring in dependency on msr-index.h for couple of 2
MSRs and the names in msr-index.h doesn't really reflect the actual
processing, they are doing. For example MSR_TURBO_RATIO_LIMIT1 for
0x1ae. The definition of 0x1AE is different on cpu model 0x55 and
beyond.
