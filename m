--- Comment #25 from Richard Neumann (mail@richard-neumann.de) ---
@Luya This is due to the fact that you, like me, use a laptop (HP Enxy x360
13-ag00xxx) which ships with an AMD SFH that has no sensor mask written to its
P2C registers. I discussed this on the mailing lists and proposed and provided
a solution by introducing a kernel module parameter [1]. However this was not
adopted in the upstream version for kernel 5.11. So I submitted my refactored
version, which I am using for nearly a year now, which incorporates such a
parameter [2]. I have not yet received any feedback on this one or the first
submission, which I sent two weeks ago and which seemingly directly went into
/dev/null. Anybody interested to review and possibly use my refactored version,
can obtain it from my github repo [3].
