Thank you for reporting this and sorry about the regression.

Also great that you've already pinpointed which exact patch
and which part of the patch is causing this problem.

Which input device is generating "SW_TABLET_MODE" events ? Are these
coming from a "Intel Virtual Switches" input device, or are these
generated by some other input device ?

And I assume that you also have an "Intel Virtual Buttons"
input device ?

> (but attaching/detaching/folding all wake the device, unless I also `echo Y > /sys/module/acpi/parameters/ec_no_wakeup` - but then I can't wake the tablet at all anymore).

I assume that this changing the mode wakes up the 2-in-1 is a pre-existing
problem which also happens with older kernels ?

Just to make sure that I understand things correctly, commenting out the new:

 	/* Some devices need this to report further events */
 	acpi_evaluate_object(handle, "VBDL", NULL, NULL);

Call not only fixes suspend/resume mode but also fixes SW_TABLET_MODE
reverting to 0 after about 1 second while it should stay 1 ?

I guess this also answers my question from above if SW_TABLET_MODE
is reported by a "Intel Virtual Switches" device and the answer
to that would be yes, right ?

I have the feeling that we are just going to need to revert
the addition of this call then IOW your solution of commenting
it out is the right solution.

The Intel VBTN interface is not documented anywhere AFAIK, so
the below is based on my understanding of things:

"VBDL" is a method called to let the firmware know that the OS
has a vbtn driver and that it can start delivering events.
I have the feeling that on your X1 Tablet Gen2 it works as
a sort of init() function and it probably causes at least
1 event (current tablet-mode event?) to be reported which
is causing the wakeup /me thinks.

"VGBS" is used to ask the firmware for the initial status
(tablet or laptop mode) on initialization. The driver also
uses the presence of the "VGBS" method to determine if
the device supports tablet-mode-sw reporting or not.

So the idea behind the patch causing your regression was
that maybe on some hw we need to call "VBDL" which enables
event reporting after every event to fix event reporting
sometimes stopping by re-enabling event reporting after
every event. This assumes that calling "VBDL" more then
once does not have any side effects, where in your case
it clearly seems to have several undesirable side-effects.

So again the fix probably is to simply just drop the
newly added "VBDL" call.

Regards,

Hans
