I see. But won't we still need the WMI module for older models then ?

Ok, so I think it would be best to just go with hardcoding the fan max
value for the 2 models now. We can always switch over to somehow
querying this over WMI later if maintaining the hardcoded table does
turn out to be more work then expected.
