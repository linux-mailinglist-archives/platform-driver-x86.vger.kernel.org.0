Right, I see in that case I guess that using the wmi_driver
interface does make sense.

So the problem is that ideapad-laptop is using the old interface
and it does:

                status = wmi_install_notify_handler(ideapad_wmi_fnesc_events[i],
                                                    ideapad_wmi_notify, priv);

And then the code to call that notifier in wmi.c goes like this:

        if (test_bit(WMI_PROBED, &wblock->flags) && wblock->dev.dev.driver) {
                struct wmi_driver *driver = drv_to_wdrv(wblock->dev.dev.driver);
                struct acpi_buffer evdata = { ACPI_ALLOCATE_BUFFER, NULL };
                acpi_status status;

                if (!driver->no_notify_data) {
                        status = get_event_data(wblock, &evdata);
                        if (ACPI_FAILURE(status)) {
                                dev_warn(&wblock->dev.dev, "failed to get event data\n");
                                return;
                        }
                }

                if (driver->notify)
                        driver->notify(&wblock->dev, evdata.pointer);

                kfree(evdata.pointer);
        } else if (wblock->handler) {
                /* Legacy handler */
                wblock->handler(event, wblock->handler_data);
        }

So if we move ahead with your new style wmi-driver for GUID 
8FC0DE0C-B4E4-43FD-B0F3-8871711C1294.

Then we hit the "true" path of the if and the legacy handler
(registered by ideapad-laptop) will never trigger.

I guess you could argue that this is a feature since your
new-style driver "replaces" ideapad-laptop, but ending up with
2 drivers for ideapad laptops / for GUID
8FC0DE0C-B4E4-43FD-B0F3-8871711C1294 and them having them have
to coordinate to decide which one to load sounds less then ideal.

So I think that your idea to add a wmi_get_event_data_for_guid()
function to wmi.c is actually a good idea.

Can you give that a try please and see how that goes ?

Regards,

Hans
