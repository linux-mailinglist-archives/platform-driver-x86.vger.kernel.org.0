As mentioned before I can live with the rename (very small chance of this causing
userspace problems) as long as the pin order stays the same. Most userspace GPIO
APIs work with pin-numbers and changing the order is guaranteed to break that.

>>> I've been thinking about this the last few days, and the APU's are all low-power, headless (no video), SBC's.  They're designed for embedded usage.  That is, they don't have generic distros like Ubuntu (et al) installed on them, so the kernel and the bundled applications are all released together, typically in an monolithic image (at least that's the case for OpenWRT).

It would be good to know the ACPI names. Also what happens with the ACPI
registered LED devices when the pcengines-apu driver loads, does it
somehow unregister those ?

If yes: Can we then make the pcengines-apu driver use the exact same names for the LEDs on new models ?
If no:  Then I guess that the ACPI registered LEDs keep working in parallel to the new LED devices ?

If the ACPI LEDs are not unregistered and keep working, then I guess there is no userspace
API breakage when using pcengines-apu on newer APU models, "just" duplicate LED devices ?

Just because we have gotten away with it once, does not mean we should do it again :)

Yes that is ok, ack.

For the new models I'm fine with whatever LED naming is preferred.

For the old already supported models changing the LED naming would require a default-off
module-parameter, which IMHO is probably not worth it.

For the new models my main worry is what happens to users of the ACPI exposed LED devices
(under /sys/class/leds/)  once the pcengines-apu driver starts binding/loading on the new models ?
