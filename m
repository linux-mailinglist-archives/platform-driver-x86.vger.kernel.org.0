Why would this be -EOPNOTSUPP and not just -EACCESS too ? To in the end both are access denials,
no password being set is really just a variant of the wrong password being set.

The way I see it the authentication mechanism and the ABI for actually
changing the settings are pretty much orthogonal. So we can add new
authentication mechanisms without that impacting the
ABI for actually changing the settings.

You are mixing up authentication and authorization here.

I guess that you are arguing for is an is_authorization_required
attribute, which can return "none" and "admin" (for now).

When no Admin password is set, everyone automatically get admin
level authority and in the Dell case (for now) all firmware-attributes
require admin authorization.

Looking at it this way has the advantage that for the current Dell
scenario the is_authorization_required sysfs-attribute would simply
always return admin.

Which is why I argued that we could omit it for now and add it as
an optional attribute, defaulting to admin when not present, later.

But if you want to we can certainly add it now and have it present
from the get go.

This obviously needs to be a per firmware-attribute setting, because in
the future and/or with other vendors different attributes may require
different levels of authorization.

Parsing the dependencies is not required for a functional userspace
application. As I explicitly stated in my previous email in many
existing builtin firmware setup UIs the dependencies are not even
shown. As for the authentication for now having a straight forward
admin + system/boot level passwords covers like 99% of the
existing use-cases.  There is no need for separate Dell / Lenovo
admin password schemes as you list above those will work identically
from the sysfs interface pov.

So having a common class interface will allow userspace apps which
work with 99% of the systems currently out there (assuming they ever get
a driver implementing the class).

I have not asked you to de-feature the sysfs interface anywhere in this thread!
