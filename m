Thank you for your work on this and thank you for the comprehensive write-up
on how Windows does modern standby.

First of all may I suggest that you take the above write-up, minus the ROG
Ally specific bits and turn this into a new documentation file under
Documentation/power ?  And also document at which point Linux currently
makes the various transitions.

And then in patches where you move the transitions, also update the docs
on what Linux does to match.

I have read the discussion about tying the display on/off calls to CRTC state
and/or exposing a userspace knob for that. I think that this needs more
discussion / design work.

OTOH IMHO it would be good to take patches 1 - 3 . Certainly 1 + 2 would
be good to have. 3 is a bit unfortunate and not necessary with the current
special ROG Ally handling in the asus-wmi driver. It might be better to
just keep the quirks there.

IMHO it would be good to submit a v2 of just patches 1 - 3 run through
checkpatch. Also the commit message of patch 3 should point to the existing
quirk code in asus-wmi.c and mention that then is no longer necessary after
patch 3, then we can discuss what is the best place for these quirks.

Rafael, what do you think about at least taking patches 1 - 3 upstream?
Reading through how Windows handles things making the display on/off
calls before suspending devices sounds like it is the right thing to do
to me.

Regards,

Hans
