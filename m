Hi,

AFAIK this just means that it's external to this table (i.e. the DSDT I
assume), not that the kernel needs to define it (I'm not sure if that's even an
option in the ACPI spec or ACPICA). So it should be in some SSDT or the ACPI
implementation is broken (unless defining devices from the kernel is really an
option and I'm just misinformed).

I believe that makes sense, given the ACPI code.

You can use acpi_evaluate_object() and acpi_evaluate_object_typed() for that.

I guess that depends on the VPC0 device. If it doesn't have a driver already
(which you can check by getting the HID of that device from the DSDT and
grep-ing for it in the kernel source), you can write your own driver against
it, install the notify-handler, and do basically whatever you want. You're not
intercepting/blocking anything by that. If there already is a driver, you'll
have to check what that does and if you can integrate your functionality there.

Given it's a Lenovo device and there are some drivers here, maybe it's also
some know interface/structure, but I guess Hans would know more about that than
I do.

Best regards,
Max
