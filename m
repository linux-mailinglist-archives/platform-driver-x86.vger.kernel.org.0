Actually I don't have a clear plan. I just thought I would start
submitting some of the trivial patches and see how far it goes. Sadly I
don't have always time to work on this project.

I think the gma500 medfield code would need some more cleanups before
being suitable for mainline. It currently includes its own MIPI-DSI
implementation instead of using the available infrastructure in recent
kernel versions.
