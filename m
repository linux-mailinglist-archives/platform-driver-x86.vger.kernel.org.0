+===========================
+HP Inc. WMI driver (hp_wmi)
+===========================
+
+Purpose
+=======
+To document the use of the HP WMI driver to manage BIOS settings & security
+solutions on HP Inc.’s commercial platforms
+
+Scope
+=====
+This document discusses the functionality of the hp_wmi driver only.
+It does not cover the support needed from applications to configure the BIOS
+settings and enable the security features.
+
+Overview
+========
+Many features of HP Commercial PC’s can be managed using Windows Management
+Instrumentation (WMI).  WMI is an implementation of Web-Based Enterprise
+Management (WBEM) that provides a standards-based interface for changing and
+monitoring system settings.
+
+The hp-wmi driver enables managing the BIOS settings and security solutions
+via sysfs, a virtual filesystem that can be used by usermode applications.
+
+When the driver loads, it creates the following directories and files in the
+/sys file system::
+
+	/sys/devices/platform/hp-wmi/spm/kek
+	/sys/devices/platform/hp-wmi/spm/sk
+	/sys/devices/platform/hp-wmi/spm/status
+	/sys/devices/platform/hp-wmi/spm/statusbin
+	/sys/devices/platform/hp-wmi/sure_admin/settings
+	/sys/devices/platform/hp-wmi/sure_start/audit_log_entries
+	/sys/devices/platform/hp-wmi/sure_start/audit_log_entry_count
+
+If the driver is unloaded, all the allocated memory is freed and directories
+and files in the /sys file system removed.
+
+Secure Platform Management
+==========================
+Many HP Commercial PC’s include a feature called Secure Platform Management
+(SPM), which replaces older password-based BIOS settings management with public
+key cryptography.  PC secure product management begins when a target system is
+provisioned with cryptographic keys that are used to ensure the integrity of
+communications between system management utilities and the BIOS.
+
+The private key is used by system management utilities to sign payloads
+containing configuration changes.  The BIOS on a target system uses the
+associated public key to verify the integrity of the payload and apply the
+changes.
+
+At the end of the PC’s lifecycle a signed deprovisioning command restores
+the factory default state.
+
+KEK Certificate (KEK) and Signing Key (SK) get provisioned and status can
+be read either as text from the status file or binary from statusbin. ::
+
+	/sys/devices/platform/hp-wmi/spm/kek
+	/sys/devices/platform/hp-wmi/spm/sk
+	/sys/devices/platform/hp-wmi/spm/status
+	/sys/devices/platform/hp-wmi/spm/statusbin
+
+**status** is a read-only file that returns ASCII text reporting the
+following information::
+
+	State:  Not Provisioned / Provisioned / Provisioning in progress
+	Version:  Major.   Minor
+	Feature Bit Mask: <16-bit unsigned number display in hex>
+	SPM Counter: <16-bit unsigned number display in base 10>
+	Signing Key Public Key Modulus (base64):
+	KEK Public Key Modulus (base64):
+
+**kek** is a write-only file that can be used to configure the RSA public
+key that will be used by the BIOS to verify signatures when setting the
+signing key.  When written, the bytes should correspond to the KEK
+certificate (x509 .DER format containing an OU).  The size of the
+certificate must be less than or equal to 4095 bytes.
+
+**sk** is a write-only file that can be used to configure the RSA public
+key that will be used by the BIOS to verify signatures when configuring
+BIOS settings and security features.  When written, the bytes should
+correspond to the modulus of the public key.  The exponent is assumed
+to be 0x10001.
+
+Sure Admin
+==========
+HP Commercial PC’s have several BIOS settings that control its behaviour and
+capabilities, many of which are related to security.  To prevent unauthorized
+changes to these settings, the system can be configured to use a Sure Admin
+cryptographic signature-based authorization string that the BIOS will use to
+verify authorization to modify the setting.
+Behind the scenes, Sure Admin uses Secure Platform Management (SPM) and WMI
+
+**settings** is a file associated with Sure Admin. BIOS settings can be read
+or written through the Sure Admin settings file in sysfs::
+
+	/sys/devices/platform/hp-wmi/sure_admin/settings
+
+Expected data format to update BIOS setting::
+
+	[BIOS setting],[new value],[auth token]
+
+Sample settings reported data::
+
+	{
+		"Class": "HPBIOS_BIOSEnumeration",
+		"Name": "USB Storage Boot",
+		"Path": "\\Advanced\\Boot Options",
+		"IsReadOnly": 0,
+		...
+		"Value": "Enable",
+		"Size": 2,
+		"PossibleValues": [
+			"Disable",
+			"Enable"
+		]
+	}
+
+Sure Start
+==========
+Sure Start provides advanced firmware protection and resiliency by identifying
+and repairing unauthorized BIOS changes.  It maintains an audit log of these
+events and other important system configuration changes.  The following sysfs
+entries can be used to read the contents of the audit log.
+
+**audit_log_entry_count** is a read-only file that returns the number of
+existing audit log events available to be read::
+
+	/sys/devices/platform/hp-wmi/sure_start/audit_log_entry_count
+
+Reported data format::
+
+	[No of entries],[log entry size in bytes],[Max number of entries supported]
+
+
+**audit_log_entries** is a read-only file that returns the events in the log::
+
+	/sys/devices/platform/hp-wmi/sure_start/audit_log_entries
