Dear Kernel devs, Mr. Hans de Goede, Mr. Ike Panhc,

I am currently working on a driver for fan control, fan speed, temperature =
sensors, and power mode (platform profile) for Lenovo Legion Laptops. Switc=
hing iGPU/dGPU could also be possible. It is a port of the closed and open =
tools in Windows LenovoLegionToolkit, Vantage, LegionFanControl. I am testi=
ng it on different laptops with the help of a forum/chat and its working qu=
ite good.

There is a README (https://github.com/johnfanv2/LenovoLegionLinux) and code=
 (https://github.com/johnfanv2/LenovoLegionLinux/blob/main/kernel_module/le=
gion-laptop.c).

I would be interested to get your opinion.

Questions

Should this extend ideapad_laptop.c or a new file?
    - pro:
        - both access parts of the same hardware
    - con:
        - both files are already quite large
        - it only works on Lenovo Legion laptops that have this=20
          custom control firmware in the embedded controller (EC)
        - there is almost no reuse of code

Which method do you prefer writing to EC memory for older models? With iore=
map or outb?=20
    - To use ioremap one needs to get the start address. It is
      different on Intel vs AMD. It is the same as a OperationRegion
      in the ACPI tables, e.g. "OperationRegion (ERAX, SystemMemory, =20
      0xFE00D400, 0xFF)". However, I have found no kernel functions =20
      to get the address (here 0xFE00D400) of a  OperationRegion. =20
      One could also hardcode it for each model/firmware.
    - alternative (which I am currently using) is sending commands   =20
      to IO ports 0x4E/0x4F (Super IO controller).=20

Background

The laptops come with an embedded controller (EC) from ITE. These usually c=
ome with a 3 point fan curve in ROM, but also can be flashed with a small a=
dditional custom program. Lenovo implemented implemented a 10 point fan cur=
ve. The program is also shipped with each EFI update.

The fan curve can be edited by writing to some memory locations in the EC. =
These locations are

The driver works by:
- directly writing/reading embedded controller memory
    - older models (2020-2021): there are two possibilities
        - the EC memory is already memory mapped, so one can=20
          use ioremap
        - one can use outb/inb and write sequenc of commands to=20
          port 0x43, 0x4F (super IO ports)
        - ideapad_laptop.c writes to some parts of EC memory=20
          with ACPI methods VPCR, VPCW. However, these do not seem =20
          to work in the memory region with the fan curve.
    - newer models (2022): these provide ACPI/WMI methods =20
      setFanCurve/getFanCurve to write to these regions. However, I =20
      have implemented that and have no models for testing

The driver works for the models 2020-2022. The code layout is heavily inspi=
red by the ideapad_laptop driver.

Best regards,

John Martens
