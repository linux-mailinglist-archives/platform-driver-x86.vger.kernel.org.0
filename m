If `dprc_command()` handles all error cases (i.e. it is not possible that `=
dprc_command()`
returns 0, but there was an error) - which seems to be the case - then I th=
ink in
that branch you should return -ENODATA and not touch `wlan_txreduce`. Becau=
se if
that branch runs, then there was no error, but the state cannot be determin=
ed,
so I think -ENODATA is an appropriate error code.

I was thinking of something like the following:

  static int tpacpi_dprc_init(...) {
    ...
    int err =3D get_wlan_state(&reduced);
    if (err && err !=3D -ENODEV)
      return err;
    else if (!err)
      has_wlantxreduce =3D true;

    err =3D get_wwan_antenna(&antenna);
    if (err && err !=3D -ENODEV)
      return err;
    else if (!err)
      has_antennatype =3D true; /* as I've commented on the second patch, t=
his
                                 variable is probably not needed */
    ...

If I'm not mistaken this is enough not to need the second argument in eithe=
r
`get_wlan_state()` or `get_wwan_antenna()`. Note, that if both functions ma=
y
return -ENODATA, you might also want to add `err !=3D -ENODATA` to the
conditions.

I think the place to determine whether the operation is supported or not
is in `tpacpi_dprc_init()` and the attribute should not be created
if it's not supported.

If you use `kstrtobool()`, you can even drop the entire switch statement.

There's not much difference, so sysfs_{create,remove}_file() would work jus=
t as fine
here. The reason why I believe `device_{create,remove}_file()` is possibly =
preferable
is that you don't need to reference the kobj and the attribute when calling=
 it,
and you're adding an attribute to a *device* (not any kobj), so device_*() =
functions
are a better fit syntactically in my opinion. But in the end, both will ach=
ieve
the same effect, so you are free to choose whichever you like.
