The reason for the firmware-attribute class original was that driver could export BIOS settings
to userspace applications, together with some metadata (min/max values, etc).

Because of this the exact meaning of each firmware attribute is usually only known to the user
changing those firmware attributes.

Your driver is a bit special in that it knows the meaning of each firmware attribute. However
you still have to follow the firmware-attribute class ABI since userspace applications do not
know this.

This is the code of device_destroy():

void device_destroy(const struct class *class, dev_t devt)
{
	struct device *dev;

	dev = class_find_device_by_devt(class, devt);
	if (dev) {
		put_device(dev);
		device_unregister(dev);
	}
}

if multiple devices of a given class are using the same devt (like MKDEV(0, 0)) then
class_find_device_by_devt() might pick the wrong device.

The fact that the other drivers are using this function is actually an error. The only
reason why this error was not noticed until now seems to be that currently only a single
driver using the firmware-attribute class is typically active at the same time.

Keep in mind that userspace applications usually do not know the meaning of such a firmware attribute.
This is why you need to supply type, current_value, etc, so that those userspace applications know enough
about the firmware attribute to show a nice settings GUI to the user (which will then use display_name to
understand the meaning of the firmware attribute).

Introducing a new "boolean" type would indeed be nice. This would allow userspace application to use a simple
on/off slider instead of a dropdown menu when displaying such firmware attributes.

In this case you could drop the "possible_values" attribute.

What is the opinion of the pdx86 maintainers on this proposal?

Good question, i will defer to the pdx86 maintainers for answering that question.

I am OK with you preferring the non-legacy modes over the legacy ones. However trying to limit yourself
to the profiles currently supported by gnome (AFAIK uses platform-profiles-daemon) is not a good idea.

I would like to see a more static mapping be implemented:

PERFORMANCE_MODE_ULTRA -> performance
PERFORMANCE_MODE_PERFORMANCE -> balanced-performance (can also be legacy if non-legacy is not available)
PERFORMANCE_MODE_OPTIMIZED -> balanced (can also be legacy is non-legacy is not available)
PERFORMANCE_MODE_QUIET -> quiet
PERFORMANCE_MODE_SILENT -> low-power

In this case the platform-profiles-daemon would have a similar job as the Samsung service, which is to
determine a suitable mapping for the supported modes to {performance, balanced, powersave}.

Looking at the code of the daemon it seems something similar is already being done, but only for the profiles
"quiet" and "low-power" (one of which is getting mapped to the "powersave" mode).

I am confident that the daemon could be extended be a bit more intelligent when it comes to determine the
mapping of the other modes.

Oops, my bad. In this case you can keep using the .brightness member of the LED device.
