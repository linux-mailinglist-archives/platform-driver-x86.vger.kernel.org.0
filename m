I like the quirk approach.  When PMC is involved, the device behavior
doesn't conform to what it advertised via PME_Support.

The v18 quirk isn't connected to PMC at all, so IIUC it avoids
D3hot/D3cold unnecessarily when amd/pmc is not loaded.

I don't object to avoiding D3hot/D3cold unconditionally.  Presumably
we *could* save a little power by using them when amd/pci isn't
loaded, but amd/pci would have to iterate through all PCI devices when
it loads, save previous state, do the quirk, and then restore the
previous state on module unload.  And it would have to use notifiers
or assume no Root Port hotplug.  All sounds kind of complicated.

Maybe it would even be enough to just clear dev->pme_support so we
know wakeups don't work.  It would be a pretty big benefit if we
didn't have to add another bit and complicate pci_prepare_to_sleep()
or pci_target_state().
