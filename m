P.S.: I completely failed to find any explanation/definition of "VBDL" or "VGBS".  If someone could point me to that, I might be able to experiment more on my own.

If I understand correctly, the purpose of acpi_evaluate_object(handle, "VBDL", NULL, NULL) is to evaluate the SW_TABLET_MODE state and to perform some kind of reset for devices that don't update the state otherwise after resume.  Calling detect_table_mode() instead seems to satisfy at least the first purpose, and remedies the problem for me - but I guess that's not a full solution?


Cheers,
Alex

> On a side note, I initially thought that detect_tablet_mode() in resume() is the culprit. intel_vbtn_pm_resume() is also included in the thaw callback (and I usually use hybrid suspend) and, after the patch, augmented with the detect_tablet_mode() routine.
> If I understand correctly the description in [1], thaw is not really resume-/restore-like except perhaps for the corner case of failed hibernation image creation. Turns out it doesn't seem to cause the harm, but still: is intel_vbtn_pm_resume() on thaw really intended? The description says it's used to undo the changes made by the preceding freeze (including prepare), but this rather seems to match intel_vbtn_pm_complete()'s definition than intel_vbtn_pm_resume()'s...
