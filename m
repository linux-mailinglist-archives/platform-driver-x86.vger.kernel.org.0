Sorry for the late response. My response is inline.

I am still uncertain about the added value of this patch. Could you 
please elaborate on how displaying the register name would assist with 
debugging?

The registers in slps0_dbg_maps are intended for diagnosing slps0 
related issues, and the register names should follow the format 
SLP_S0_DBG_(1,2,3).

Additionally, the full 32-bit register data should not be displayed 
here, as some of the bits are reserved and must not be exposed to users.
