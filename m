I'm not 100% sure if this will work everywhere and I'm a bit worried the
VPCCMD_W_TOUCHPAD calls might cause problems on some devices. You did
mention that the ideapad windows software seems to always make
VPCCMD_W_TOUCHPAD calls.

But still, one of my goals with this series is to have the ideapad-laptop
driver poke less at the hw, to avoid the poking potentially causes issues.

Where as your suggested auto-detection makes the driver poke the hw more,
not less.

Thinking more about this makes me wonder: "why not just
entirely remove the whole touchpad sysfs attribute?"

Just removing the entire touchpad sysfs attribute will greatly simplify
things and normal userspace does not depend on it at all. Its only
potential users are custom user scripts and ideapad specific control
panels or some such.

And the custom control panels already need to deal with the touchpad
sysfs attribute not always being there.

I do realize that removing it might be a bit too big of a hammer,
so instead I plan to have it hidden by default and allow enabling
it through a module parameter.

Serr the next version of this patch-set (coming up soon).

Gating this with a module parameter will reduce all the maintenance
burden of having allow-lists are fragile auto-detect code for
a feature which I believe hardly anyone uses at all.

I don't agree with having the touchpad sysfs attr visible on
the ctrl_ps2_aux_port devices, writing it will do nothing and as you
mentioned yourself some ideapad specific tools will show a touchpad
on/off option when this file is visible, which then will not work.

Note that just hiding the touchpad sysfs attr be default makes
this whole discussion mute though.

This was only added recently (until recently there was no touchpad_ctrl_via_ec
flag at all) and seems to be copied and pasted from the rfkill code, where
we know that manually disabling the hw-rfkill bit is actually needed on
some models without an actual hw-rfkill switch...

This is not a problem introduced by this patch-set, touchpad-store never
controlled the ps2-aux port.

As mentioned above IMHO just hiding the touchpad sysfs attr here is better
(avoids the need to make touch-store have a special case for this).

These devices have a working touchpad-toggle hotkey + a LED to indicate
the status, so there really is no need for the sysfs attr.

(which makes me realize there is really little need for the sysfs attr
at all, so just always hiding it is easier, avoiding all sorts of possible
issues, see above).

I've fixed this in the next version of my patch set.

Hans
