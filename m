But can't they already do this by just unplugging the AC and
then let the machine die ?

How is this different, does it somehow magically flicks on the
AC just before the battery deep-discharge protection kicks in
so no unsaved work is lost ?

I have never used this, but that seems unlikely.

Or is the advantage of this that the AC being present results in
no nagging low battery warnings as well as no auto-shutdown
near the end ?

If the advantage of this is indeed the no nagging + auto-shutdown
a better fix would be to do some userspace work to allow a
full, undisturbed, discharge while not on AC for calibration
purposes. That would also work on any vendor laptop, which would
be a big added bonus.

I do believe that Lenovo does want to support doing a calibration
cycle under Linux. This whole thread got resurfaced / revived by
Mark because of discussions with Lenovo about offering better
battery management options under Linux.

Ok, so I think we should look at the end goal here, which is doing
a battery calibration run, which AFAIK means discharging until
the machine turns off (by itself rather then an emergency shutdown
by the OS), followed by charging to 100%/full in one go.

So as mentioned before if we can disable the emergency shutdown
then we should be able to do this on all vendor laptops.

But I guess the real question here is, what do the Lenovo tools
under Windows do?

Mark, I assume that the Lenovo battery management tool under Windows
does allow doing a calibration, can you figure out how this works?

Maybe that does actually use force_disharge and things got mixed up
when you asked the firmware team about all 3 features in one email,
and the other 2 are only for testing purposes?

I'm not Mark, but I believe that these are officially supported,
as mentioned before Lenovo does want to offer better battery management
options under Linux.

Hans
