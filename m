Ah, okay, you are talking with regard to the current patch. I talked
in generic terms.

No-one is objecting to this. I agree that integration of regulators
and ACPI should be done in a specific way if needed at all.

Of course, no objections to this.

In some (I suppose rear) cases it may be used by DT-enabled platforms as well.
I can imagine the case when you have a system in ROM and only what you
can do to change DTB there is either use DT overlays (which seems to
be not working, plenty of gaps there according to a Wiki I saw once)
or do something in the board files.

So, if you replace "ACPI" with the "firmware resource provider" in the
above paragraph, I will agree 100% with you.
