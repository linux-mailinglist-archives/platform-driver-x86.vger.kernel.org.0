Changes in v2:
 - Rebased to Linus's latest as requested
 - Updated documentation reference
 - Updated MAINTAINER file
 - Removed X86_PLATFORM_DRIVERS_LENOVO as I was worried about
   maintaining backwards compatibility for the distros.
 - Removed 2nd patch in series splitting out hkeys. That will be for
   the future

-

-	  your ThinkPad's video output ports instead of this feature,
-	  don't think twice: do it and say N here to save memory and avoid
-	  bad interactions with X.org.
-
-	  NOTE: access to this feature is limited to processes with the
-	  CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability, to avoid local DoS issues in platforms

-config THINKPAD_ACPI_HOTKEY_POLL

-	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
-	default y

-	  Some thinkpad models benefit from NVRAM polling to detect a few of
-	  the hot key press events.  If you know your ThinkPad model does not
-	  need to do NVRAM polling to support any of the hot keys you use,
-	  unselecting this option will save about 1kB of memory.
-
-	  ThinkPads T40 and newer, R52 and newer, and X31 and newer are
-	  unlikely to need NVRAM polling in their latest BIOS versions.
-
-	  NVRAM polling can detect at most the following keys: ThinkPad/Access
-	  IBM, Zoom, Switch Display (fn+F7), ThinkLight, Volume up/down/mute,
-	  Brightness up/down, Display Expand (fn+F8), Hibernate (fn+F12).
