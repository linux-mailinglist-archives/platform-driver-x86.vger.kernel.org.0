Ah I see, so you are interpreting cool as "cool to touch / low temps" not
as in cool by not generating much heat. That is not an unreasonable interpretation
and I see that the hp-wmi stuff you are working on has separate cool and
quiet profiles (and does not seem to have one which explicit targets low-power).

So I agree that we should not lump these together leading to the following
set of standard profile names (for now, can be extended in the future) :

                 quiet:                  Emphasises quiet running
		cool:                   Emphasises low temperatures
                 low-power:              Emphasises low power consumption
                 balanced-low-power:     Balances between low power consumption
                                         and performance with a slight bias
                                         towards low power
                 balanced:               Balance between low power consumption
                                         and performance
                 balanced-performance:   Balances between performance and low
                                         power consumption with a slight bias
                                         towards performance
                 performance:            Emphasises performance

That is a good question, IMHO the kernels role here is to provide a
mechanism to control these kinda profiles in various systems / components.

If the UI for this takes the form of a slider going from low-power
to performance, then on hardware which only offers cool and quiet
as options, like the hp-wmi interface seems to do, which one to
pick when the user selects low-power is a policy decision left
up to userspace. Likely the performance-profile-daemon Bastien is
working on, so from the sysfs API pov this is solved by just offering
cool and quiet as profile choices and then userspace needs to figure
out what to do (sorry Bastien).

Note if the driver knows that one of cool vs quiet also leads
to low-power, while for the other one that is not so much the case,
then it would make sense for the driver to also offer low-power as
an alias to one of the two (*) since the chances that the driver knows
this are better then that the performance-profile-daemon will know.

Regards,

Hans


*) or maybe in that case offer only low-power + one of the
other 2 options ?  Either way works I guess...
