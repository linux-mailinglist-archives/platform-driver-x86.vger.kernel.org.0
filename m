Here I should note that I will not wait for systemd.

As part of adding support for these devices with Handheld Daemon, I
snag the powerbutton already and I only have one userspace app running
anyway, Steam. The idea here would be double tap the powerbutton to
enter a "Download Assistant", custom lockscreen pops up, and two
seconds later DPMS triggers, system enters Sleep state and either when
a battery target is reached or the download finishes, it transitions
to actual suspend.

The challenges here would be if the _DSM calls for Display Off and
Sleep Entry are a nothingburger and do not save much battery and that
Steam uses very heavy compression that does a lot of CPU.

If I find it not useful, maybe I will skip it.
