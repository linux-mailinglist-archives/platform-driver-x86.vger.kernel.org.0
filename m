Isn't the whole idea behind nvidia-wmi-ec-backlight that the backlight's
pwm input is connected to the EC (it is sorta in the name) and then always
is controlled by the EC independent of the mode ?

At least I was under the impression that that was the whole idea?

I will forward your email to the reporter and ask them to get
in touch with you and then lets see from there.

Regards,

Hans
