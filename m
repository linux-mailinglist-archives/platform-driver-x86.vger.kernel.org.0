You are currently attempting to fix a problem that does not exists (or
you haven't made us aware of), in a way that is causing regressions:
no -- calling csee twice is not a problem and we have absolutely no reasons
to suspect it is.

First: the onus is on you to justify, with logs and a thorough explanation,
why you are modifying a module. You have so far failed to do so.

Second: give us explanation of why you think downloading games with screen off
has something to do with the asus-wmi driver and belongs to the same patch series.

A compiled version of the kernel tag v6.11 has mcu_powersave=0 working flawlessly,
that very same kernel, compiled with the very same .config, with your patches on
top exhibits what was documented: there is no reason to use fingers here.

So... for one your patches do something else (and they seems to be related to
activities done in background while in s2idle), and two you are saying that
since you don't understand why a regression is happening it is okay to ignore that.

I will be here waiting for the result, when you have identified the reason of regression I
documented, include me in CC or reach me out privately with the work ready to test.

Again, userspace software running in s2idle has absolutely nothing to do with
acpi entries. You need to decide what this patch is all about:
If it is about asus-wmi then identify and solve regressions before resubmitting.
If it is about downloading games while sleeping then create a new idle driver
(this way you won't risk breaking what has been confirmed working for months or years),
do a request for comment on a proposal, or propose an interface to the userspace
that applications will use to carry on tasks while hardware is in s2idle
and drop the useless asus-wmi part as it does not belong there.

As it stands this work does not solve any problem and does not allow downloads
to happen while the console is sleeping: pick one and follow that route.
