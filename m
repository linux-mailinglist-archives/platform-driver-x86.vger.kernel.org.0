Sure, I'll do that. Expect it later today.

The '!=' would work too. The (frame-)aligned pointer is guaranteed to
always be either equal to or greater than the source pointer, so that's
equivalent to '>'. I'd kind of like to keep the unlikely though, as that
indicates it's part of the failure path and it's a failure we don't
expect frequently.

That section could probably also use a comment.
