I think we discussed this previously already but in any case, instead of
removing the tag from the "main" driver, we can make certain "safe"
parts of the driver available without that tag. That would allow you to
read the things the controller exposes and allow distros safely include
the driver too. By "safe" parts, I mean the information available
through the SPI flash controller without actually sending commands to
the flash chip. I think this is the information everybody (on this
thread at least) is interested in. Unless I'm mistaken - I did not check
the original patch. If that's not enough we can possibly expand it to
cover the controllers that only use hardware sequencer since they
operate on a certain limited set of ops that should not break anything
accidentally.
