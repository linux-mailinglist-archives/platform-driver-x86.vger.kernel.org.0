Good to hear!

Surely. Alternatively we could re-register the hwmon device after an
extension was added.

It's not really difficult. The problem is in the callback functions
going from a 'struct power_supply' back to the correct extension struct
for use with container_of() to access the drivers private data.

But we can add a marker member to 'struct power_supply_ext' with which
the callback can figure out which of the registered extensions is its
own. Something like "led_hw_trigger_type" in the LED subsystem.

And some documentation about how conflicts are to be resolved.
