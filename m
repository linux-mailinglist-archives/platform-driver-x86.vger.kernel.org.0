Ack KEY_VENDOR sounds good to me for the doubletap on the trackpoint event.

What about the new Fn + N keycombo which also generates a WMI
event which we want to translate to a key code to launch a
(to be written) debug-info collecting app for when the customer
calls Lenovo support.

Mark suggested a new KEY_SYS_DEBUG_INFO for that. So do we use:

#define KEY_INFO                0x166   /* AL OEM Features/Tips/Tutorial */

for this, or do we define a new keycode ?

Mark would using KEY_INFO for this work for you.

Dmitry any opinion on this ?

Regards,

Hans
