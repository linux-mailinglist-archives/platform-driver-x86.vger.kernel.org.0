I haven't done any testing with D1 or D2 as Linux doesn't select these

There was no strong reason for it.  A 1-bit bitfield struct pci_dev will 
actually make it easier for this quirk to live in a more proper home for 
the situation (drivers/platform/x86/amd/pmc/pmc.c).

Linux doesn't select D3cold for this root port, but it should affect both.

This is why my earlier attempts (v16 and v17) tried to tie it to 
constraints.  These are what the uPEP driver in Windows uses to make the 
decision of what power state to put integrated devices like the root 
port into.

In Windows if no uPEP driver is installed "Windows internal policy" 
dictates what happens.  If the uPEP driver is installed then it 
influences the policy based upon the constraints.

Rafael had feedback against constraints in v17, which is why I'm back to 
a quirk for v18.

This issue as I've described it is specific to AMD Ryzen.
I expect it to be an ongoing issue.  I also expect unless we use 
constraints or convince the firmware team to add a _S0W object with a 
value of "0" for the sake of Linux that we will be adding IDs every year 
to wherever this lands as we reproduce it on newer SoCs.

The hardware team describes the issue to me as specific to how the 
internal interrupt routing works with the USB4 controller connected to 
this root port.

I personally really thought the constraints approach from v16 and v17 
did this well and would have scaled effectively.

As Rafael has opposition to it what I'm thinking from everyone's 
feedback today is to add code into amd_pmc_probe() that twiddles a new 
bit for the matching device in `struct pci_dev`, maybe called 
`no_d3_for_wakeup`.

Then as we add PMC support for new devices, we can add a new line to a 
switch/case to set that bit if necessary for the platform.

Sure I'll add a dev_info or pci_info when it's set.
