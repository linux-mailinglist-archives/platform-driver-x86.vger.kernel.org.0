Sounds good, I'd be happy to help review and approve any Surface related
patches. However, I think it would be beneficial if you and Mark still
have a final look (and say) over the ones I've reviewed and accepted (if
that's not already a given). I feel like I may lack a bit of experience
for this job and might miss some things.

I'll add the MAINTAINERS entry and send a v3 later today, if that's OK.

Regards,
Max
