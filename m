If you don't insist on *requiring* commas, then I think the following works=
:

  while (sscanf(&buf[at], "%u:%u %n", &temp, &prct, &len) =3D=3D 2) {
    /* process `temp` and `prct` */

    at +=3D len;
    at +=3D strspn(&buf[at], ",");
  }

But please, whatever parser you end up submitting, make sure it is thorough=
ly tested.

I am not sure, you can find some uses among hwmon drivers.

If you look into linux/hwmon-sysfs.h, then you can see that `SENSOR_DEVICE_=
ATTR_2()`
defines and initializes a `struct sensor_device_attribute_2` object:

  struct sensor_device_attribute_2 {
    struct device_attribute dev_attr;
    u8 index;
    u8 nr;
  };

So it has a normal device attribute inside it, and two extra pieces of data=
.
One difference is that when you create the `struct attribute` array
(`platform_attributes`), then you will need to use `&some_name1.dev_attr.at=
tr`.

And the idea here is that the show/store callbacks receive a pointer to the
device attribute that is being read/written, and we know for a fact, that t=
his
device attribute is inside a `sensor_device_attribute_2` struct. And thus w=
e can
use the `to_sensor_dev_attr_2()` macro to get a pointer to the "outer"
`sensor_device_attribute_2` struct that contains the `device_attribute` str=
uct
that we have a pointer to.

So now the `index` and `nr` members of that struct can be accessed. You cou=
ld
store the index of the fan (e.g. 0 for CPU, 1 for GPU) in `index`, and the =
profile
in `nr`. The `ASUS_THROTTLE_THERMAL_POLICY_*` macros go from 0 to 2, so I t=
hink
those would be perfect candidates for the curve index. That's why I used
`ASUS_THROTTLE_THERMAL_POLICY_SILENT` in the example.

The fan curve associated with the attribute can now be
accessed in `asus->fans[sattr->index].curves[sattr->nr]`.

`to_sensor_dev_attr_2()` is just a wrapper around `container_of()`, so if y=
ou're
familiar with the idea behind that, this shouldn't be too hard to wrap your
head around.

  #define to_sensor_dev_attr_2(_dev_attr) \
    container_of(_dev_attr, struct sensor_device_attribute_2, dev_attr)

What it does, is that if you give it a pointer to the `dev_attr` member of =
a
`struct sensor_device_attribute_2`, then it'll give you back a pointer
to the `struct sensor_device_attribute_2`. `container_of()` basically does =
a
"conversion" from pointer-to-member-of-struct-X to pointer-to-struct-X.

In some sense, you might think of `struct device_attribute` as the "base cl=
ass",
and the `struct sensor_device_attribute_2` as the "derived class" here. And=
 what
`to_sensor_dev_attr_2()` is a down-cast from the base class to the derived,
e.g. something like this in C++:

  struct device_attribute { ... };
  struct sensor_device_attribute_2 : device_attribute {
    u8 index;
    u8 nr;
  };

  /* `device_attr` is of type `struct device_attribute *` */
  static_cast<sensor_device_attribute_2 *>(device_attr);
  /* there's also dynamic_cast which can do the same down-cast,
     but it does runtime type checking as well */
  /* both of the mentioned C++ casts check if the pointer is nullptr,
     normal container_of() does not that, but there is container_of_safe() =
*/

It may be too detailed, I'm not sure; please let me know if you have other =
questions.
