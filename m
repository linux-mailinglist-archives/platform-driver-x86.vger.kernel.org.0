I can't see it as a pain. Simple do the same kmemdup() for the case when
is_array = false and DEV_TYPE_REF?

By the way, don't we need to update property_entry_{get,set}_pointer()?

Yes, and this is a lot of benefit!

Nope, is_array is exactly what it tells us about the content. Its functional
load is to distinguish which union (value vs. pointer) we are using.
