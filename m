The file is cammed pmc.c and states "AMD SoC Power Management Controller 
Driver", so PMC, right?

You propose adding function called amd_pmc_is_cpu_supported() which to me 
reads "is PMC supported on this CPU?" since you don't have anything else 
in the function name to quality a sub-feature that would be be tested for 
supported or not.

It begs a question, why probe doesn't always return error when PMC is not 
supported by the CPU? Can you see the problem now?

This kind of information should be stated the changelog up front.

So is that function testing support for Spill to DRAM? Clearly, 
Spill-to-DRAM != PMC, that's the second problem here related to function 
naming.

s2d is short for Spill to DRAM I guess?

So in both occassions amd_pmc_check_sup_cpuid() testing support for s2d 
rather than PMC (it certainly looks that way)? If so, name the function 
accordingly (I suggest amd_pmc_s2d_supported()) and put a little bit more 
explanation into the changelog and we're done here.
