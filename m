FWIW in KDE we already planned to turn the screen off before suspend
to deal better with spurious wakeups, and that'll be in the next
version of Plasma. I think it's fine if you just leave this up to
userspace, and maybe write to wayland-devel, so that other compositor
developers are aware they should do the same.
