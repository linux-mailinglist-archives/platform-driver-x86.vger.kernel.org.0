The upstream it87 driver is severely out of date. I had an out-of-tree driver
with various improvements which I didn't upstream, first because no one was willing
to review changes and then because it had deviated too much. I pulled it from
public view because I got pounded for not upstreaming it, because people started
demanding support (not asking, demanding) for it, and because Gigabyte stopped
providing datasheets for the more recent ITE chips and it became effectively
unmaintainable.

Some ITE chips have issues which can cause system hangs if accessed directly.
I put some work to remedy that into the non-upstream driver, but that was all
just guesswork. Gigabyte knows about the problem (or so I was told from someone
who has an NDA with them), but I didn't get them or ITE to even acknowledge it
to me. I even had a support case open with Gigabyte for a while, but all I could
get out of them is that they don't support Linux and what I would have to reproduce
the problem with Windows for them to provide assistance (even though, again,
they knew about it).

As for using ACPI locks or WMI to ensure that ACPI leaves the chip alone while
the driver accesses chips directly: That is an option, but it has (at least)
two problems.

First, ACPI access methods are not well documented or standardized. I had tried
to find useful means to do that some time ago, but I gave up because each board
(even from the same vendor) handles locking and accesses differently. We would
end up with lots of board specific code. Coincidentally, that was for ASUS boards
and the nct6775 driver.

Second, access through ACPI is only one of the issues. Turns out there are two
ITE chips on many of the Gigabyte boards nowadays, and the two chips talk to each
other using I2C. My out-of-tree driver tried to remedy that by blocking those
accesses while the driver used the chip, but, again, without Gigabyte / ITE
support this was never a perfect solution, and there was always the risk that
the board ended up hanging because that access was blocked for too long.
Recent ITE chips solve that problem by providing memory mapped access to the
chip registers, but that is only useful if one has a datasheet.

Overall, I don't think it makes much sense trying to make significant changes
to the it87 driver without pulling in all the changes I had made, and without
finding a better fix for the cross-chip access problems. I for sure won't have
time for that (and getting hwmon patches reviewed is still very much an issue).

Having said that, I am of course open to adding WMI/ACPI drivers for the various
boards. Good luck getting support from Gigabyte, though. Or from ASUS, for that
matter.
