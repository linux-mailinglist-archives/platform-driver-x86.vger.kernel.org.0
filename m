There are a few problems here:
1. sope creep: either do a cleanup or solve bugs. The fact that your flow z13
doesn't load hid-asus correctly has nothing to do with the initialization of anime.
The fact that hid-asus is driving leds instead of asus-wmi has nothing to do with
anime matrix initialization either.
2. not sending the initialization can get hardware misbehave because it
is left in an uninitialized state.
3. there are absolutely zero reasons to do that. There are even less reasons
as to do it as part of this patchset.

There are no bugs opened that ties initialization of devices to bugs.
Quite the opposite: I can guarantee you that removing part of the
init will introduce regressions.

The onus is on you to provide strong evidence that the removal is
a necessary act.

Regardless it is not in the scope of this patchset: remove it.

Yes it's risky to remove initialization sequences for a device that is
in every modern ASUS laptop and is tied to the EC.

This doesn't make much sense: why would anyone remove
a command from the kernel, that can be very well essential to some models
(sleep can break, for example) just to add it back in a userspace program?

What does it mean I have to validate I am speaking to an asus device?
Software selects devices by known attribute, one of them is the vid:pid....
Beside what does this have to do with the removal of initialization commands
from the kernel?

Even late initializing devices can lead to problems. Windows doesn't do that:
as soon as asus drivers are loaded all relevant initialization sequences are 
sent; Windows is the only officially supported OS: do not introduce commands
flow divergence without strong reasons backing it up.
