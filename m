Hi Hans,

it seems that the recent update of intel-vtn broke the keyboard input
on some laptops with libinput:
  https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1175599

Blacklisting intel-vtn fixes the issue, so it's likely the falsely
reported tablet mode switch that leads libinput misbehaving.  The
affected machines are Acer E5-511 and ASUS X756UX laptops, and they
shouldn't have the tablet mode at all, AFAIK.

Could you take a look?  I guess it's the commit cfae58ed681c that
broke.  The chassis type is Notebook on those, and this type should be
excluded as well as Laptop.

The dmidecode outputs and other info are found in the bugzilla above:
  https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/attachment.cgi?id=841999
  https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/attachment.cgi?id=842039

The one for ASUS is embedded in hwinfo outpt:
  https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/attachment.cgi?id=841157


thanks,

Takashi
