Hi there

Sorry for pinging in a bit late, been under a lot of work lately.

You can poke the Toshiba BIOS interface directly via /dev/toshiba_acpi
to test your findings, once it is ironed out, you can start making patches
for inclusion in the kernel.

I know there are a lot of areas where the driver is lacking features due to
hardware restrictions on the machines I had at the time, so it's good to
see a bit more movement here.

Cheers
Azael
