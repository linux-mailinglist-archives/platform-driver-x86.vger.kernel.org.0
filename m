I agree there needs to be /some/ sort of dependency.
One thing I was thinking you could do is use:

wmi_has_guid() to tell whether or not the "GZ" interface is even present 
from the "Other" driver.  Move the GUID for the GZ interface into a 
common header both drivers include.

However that only helps in the case of a system that supports custom but 
not GZ.  I think you still will need some sort of symbol to either get a 
pointer to the platform profile class or tell if the profile for the 
driver is set to custom.

I personally don't see a problem with a simple symbol like this:

bool lenovo_wmi_gamezone_is_custom(void);

You could then have your logic in all the store and show call a helper 
something like this:

static bool lenovo_wmi_custom_mode() {
	if (!wmi_has_guid(GZ_GUID)
		return true;

	if (!IS_REACHABLE(CONFIG_LENOVO_WMI_GAMEZONE))
		return true;

	return lenovo_wmi_gamezone_is_custom();
}

This is good to hear considering the concerns raised by some others.

But FWIW we have nothing in the firmware attributes API documentation 
that mandates what the firmware does for storage of settings across a 
power cycle so this is currently up to the platform to decide.
