Thank you for the patch and for the nice commit message.

I've come up with a slightly different version where -ENODATA is checked
inside the fan_curve_check_present() helper. This way if e.g. there
is a CPU fan-curve but no GPU fan-curve, because e.g. there is no
separate GPU fan the hwmon device will still get registered for just
the CPU fan curve.

I'll send out my version right after this email, if you can test it
that would be great.

Since I've come up with a different approach I did not try to apply it,
but inlining often leads to issues due to replaceing tabs with spaces
and linewrapping. Although it seems your mail-client has done neither,
which is good.

Still for the next time, the preferred way to submit patches is to
use git send-email which does not have any of these issues.

Regards,

Hans
