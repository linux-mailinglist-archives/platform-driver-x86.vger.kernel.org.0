Okay I see. Yes I tested this before submission. The issue here for the 
ASUS laptops is that 
/sys/bus/platform/devices/asus-nb-wmi/throttle_thermal_policy is still 
accessible and writeable. If this is written to then the 
platform_profile becomes out of sync with it. So the option here is:

1. notify platform_profile, or
2. remove the sysfs for throttle_thermal_policy

Thinking about it I would prefer option 2 so we do not end up with two 
paths for duplicate functionality. As far as I know asusctl is the only 
(very) widely distributed and used tool for these laptops that uses the 
existing throttle_thermal_policy sysfs path, so it is very easy to sync 
asusctl with the changes made here.

Just to be super clear:
The notify is on write to 
/sys/bus/platform/devices/asus-nb-wmi/throttle_thermal_policy as 
described above.
Not to /sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile

Luke.
