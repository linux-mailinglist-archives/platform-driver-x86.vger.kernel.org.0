No, I just finished writing this. I cannot test if it still works correctly=
 for
non-WMI cases, and I think using device address zero for WMI is probably a =
bit
hackish.

Please also note that this patch only adds access via WMI for i/o port 0x29=
5,
while superio access is still using the "traditional" method. There are how=
ever
also WMI methods for superio access, at least on my board, and it would
probably be safer to use those as well. However I would propose to first sp=
lit
the superio functionality into a separate driver. Comments in nct6775 seem =
to
imply that this was/is intended to be done at some point.
