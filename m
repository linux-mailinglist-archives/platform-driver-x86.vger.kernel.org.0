Thank you for your work on this.

Overall 3 patches look good to me.

Sebastian, any chance you could take a look at patch 3/3
and maybe give me an ack for merging that through the pdx86
tree ?   (assuming you are ok with it)


2 small remarks about patch 2/3:

Remark 1:

+	rval = toshiba_battery_charge_mode_set(toshiba_acpi,
+					       (value < 90) ? 1 : 0);

Playing Devil's advocate here: to a casual reader this looks
a bit weird, why would I want to enable "charge mode"
(whatever that is).

IMHO it would be better to call the set (and get) function something
like e.g.:  toshiba_battery_set_eco_charge_mode()  So basicaly
add "eco" somewhere in the name. IIRC that is what Toshiba themselves
use right ?  I think that makes the meaning of the mode being 0 vs
it being one more clear.

That and/or add an enum for the 0/1 values and use the enum instead,
the enum could e.g. look something like this:

enum {
	TOSHIBA_CHARGE_FULL_CHARGE,
	TOSHIBA_CHARGE_ECO_MODE,
};

Note either of the suggested changes would be enough to make
the code more clear. Also this and especially the suggested
names are just a suggestion.


Remark 2:

+static int toshiba_acpi_battery_add(struct power_supply *battery)
+{
+	if (toshiba_acpi == NULL) {
+		pr_err("Init order issue\n");
+		return -ENODEV;


This will never happen. The hook is only registered when
toshiba_acpi != NULL and it will get unregistered before
toshiba_acpi gets set to NULL on remove.

+	}
+	if (!toshiba_acpi->battery_charge_mode_supported)
+		return -ENODEV;

If toshiba_acpi->battery_charge_mode_supported == false then
the acpi_battery_hook battery_hook will never get registered
and thus this will never get called.

+	if (device_add_groups(&battery->dev, toshiba_acpi_battery_groups))
+		return -ENODEV;
+	return 0;
+}

So you really only need the device_add_groups() which should never
faill and if it does fail then propagating the actual error would
be better.

So all in all IMHO this function can be simplified to just:

static int toshiba_acpi_battery_add(struct power_supply *battery)
{
	return device_add_groups(&battery->dev, toshiba_acpi_battery_groups);
}


Regards,

Hans
