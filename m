That's something I can make work, yes.

I would say that, you could probably have CnQF transparently replacing
the more static "balanced" profile if it is available, and have a
separate setting to force enable/disable it as a kernel command-line
for debugging or if the BIOS menu doesn't offer it as an option.

That way the balanced mode would work like a more refined automatic
profile switcher, and make the default experience better, without the
disappearing profiles, or the user-space API headaches.
