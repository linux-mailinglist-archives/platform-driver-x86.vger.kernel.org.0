I think it would be better if you sketched out your proposed data
structure(s) so we are talking about the same things. But please note
that when you are dealing with property arrays we need to keep the easy
way of defining them, which means we should not be splitting individual
entries.

Right. Maybe I should clean it up as well.

Yes, I think you are right about property_set_pointer() at least.

But u64 values are.
