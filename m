Hi again Armin! I think I am finally with you on most of this, I think
jet lag and general craziness made me a little extra dense for a week
or two :)

Yes ok, as said, I am with you all now on this I think :)

As a prototype for v5 I have created a new struct for each "firmware
attribute" that helps me keep everything linked together with all of
the different sub attributes for each different "fw attribute"
including allowing a link back to my samsung_galaxybook instance
without using the global pointer. At the end of the day, if I wanted
to avoid using a global pointer, I needed a way to grab the private
data based on either the kobj or the attr parameters to the show/store
method of these individual sub attributes within each "firmware
attribute", so what I have done is added the kobj_attribute as a
struct member and then manually init+filled this kobj_attributes
during probe, so I can now grab the parent struct instance using
container_of() within the show/store functions which then gets me to
my pointer. I thought about using the kset or something else for this
but it seemed like kobj_attribute supported being a struct member
better and gave the least amount of headaches from what I could tell.

After trying to fight my way through this problem, I have an idea of
what a better "dream scenario" would for me as a user/consumer of the
firmware attributes interface -- namely that there is some kind of way
to register and unregister by "type" (e.g. "I want a new enumeration
fw attr; here is its parent, its name, and all of the functions for
show/store of the required attributes, plus a data pointer that I can
pack together with my attribute/somehow reach within the show/store
functions"). I have handled a bit of this myself now in the working v5
of samsung-galaxybook (just a minimal version of what it requires) but
as said it currently relies on creating the kobj_attributes (at least
those where I need the pointer) as struct members that I can later use
with container_of() instead of creating static ones using the various
__ATTR.. macros.

Please feel free to say if any of this sounds totally (or partially?)
off, otherwise I will try to test a bit more, clean up, and work
through any checkpatch exceptions and get this sent as a v5.

Yes again sorry for being dense -- now with a little sleep and time to
marinate this makes total sense, and it is a lot easier to just use
device_unregister() like you say. This will be included in v5.

Now that I have finally taken a better understanding of this, I see
your point. Yes, nice with a boolean that could give a slider in a GUI
or similar, but does not really change a whole lot in the driver
implementation. I will go with enumeration type for now as mentioned
and it can always be changed later if this new type comes.

I understand the thought here but my only problem and what sort of
"itches" at me is that most of these devices are not "Ultra" models
and they will never have an "Ultra" mode. For the non-Ultra models,
"Performance mode" *is* "Performance mode" (meaning, it is the mode
which prioritizes performance over anything else) so for me it feels
best if these non-Ultra models (again majority of these devices) can
have the Performance mode that they should have. And you can maybe
argue that "Ultra" is in fact its own mode entirely -- when you use
this mode on these devices, they really scream (the fans, mostly, that
is) and they get super hot haha :)

Other than this Ultra vs Performance question, I do agree with you and
think it makes sense. My first thought if we want to actually
"simplify" this in this way is if there could actually exist a
platform profile called "ultra" then it would be just a perfect 1:1
mapping (other than taking legacy modes into account).

This "perfect fit" for samsung-galaxybook would be to create a new
platform profile called something like PLATFORM_PROFILE_ULTRA, but
that seems like a bit of a tall order... Would it make more sense to
implement this "ultra" mode using the new PLATFORM_PROFILE_CUSTOM and
then map them like this?

PERFORMANCE_MODE_ULTRA -> custom (named "ultra" if that is possible?)
PERFORMANCE_MODE_PERFORMANCE (or PERFORMANCE_MODE_PERFORMANCE_LEGACY)
-> performance
PERFORMANCE_MODE_OPTIMIZED (or PERFORMANCE_MODE_OPTIMIZED_LEGACY) -> balanc=
ed
PERFORMANCE_MODE_QUIET -> quiet
PERFORMANCE_MODE_SILENT -> low-power

Thought admittedly I am not 100% familiar with how
PLATFORM_PROFILE_CUSTOM is implemented to work; I have a vague memory
that I read somewhere that this was roughly the intention? But I am
not sure if it is actually implemented to work this way. But if it
will in fact work "out of the box" including with
platform_profile_cycle() for the hotkey then it seems like the
cleanest and easiest approach.

If this is possible, then my best guess for the logic for this mapping
in samsung-galaxybook could be changed to loop the "supported modes"
forwards instead of backwards, and just let the "legacy" modes be
written first (as they seem to always come first in the list), and
then in case the non-legacy mode exists later in the array, it will
just replace the already-mapped legacy value with the new non-legacy
value, and thus skip any kind of condition-based checking/mapping
entirely. Is that sort of more like what you had in mind?
