By examining the ACPI tables of the devices that support the AWCC
functionality, I realized none of the newer devices support the LED
interface.

At the time I added quirks for those devices I assigned `num_zones = 2`,
because I mimicked the default behavior of the driver, which was
assigning quirk_unknown to devices not listed on the DMI table.

This is of course my bad, but fortunately in all these cases the WMAX
device returned an error code safely.

I can send a fix for this, but it would require a bit of refactoring of
the init function, which I think would cause merge conflicts if we end
up reworking this driver. Also we don't know "FOR SURE" which devices
don't support the LED interface, although I'm pretty sure it comes down
to the UID of the device, but it's just a guess in the end.

Thoughts on sending a fix? I believe leaving zones is pretty harmless in
the end.

I would love to have advice from Dell on this too. Hopefully they'll
get back at us at some point. Any time now...

If you don't change your mind with the information given above, I'm ok
with this. That's why I splitted the driver at the end of the series :p

This is good to know!

Yes, it's really unfortunate Dell didn't make a new device for the
thermal methods.

This would be an awesome feature! Will you implement Pali Rohar's decoder?
I'll be sure to make the necessary improvements once is done.
