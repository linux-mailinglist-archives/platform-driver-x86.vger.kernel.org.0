Ok, so that means that this v2 is doing the right thing, as this version returns -ENODEV if any of the types are missing, just as before.

Since this adds a couple of useful robustness checks I'm going to merge this now.

As mentioned before, can you (Prasanth and/or Divya) please take care of the TODO from the commit message:

TODO: The populate_foo_data() functions should also be made more
robust. The should check the type of each of the elements matches the
type which they expect and in case of populate_enum_data()
obj->package.count should be passed to it as an argument and it should
re-check this itself since it consume a variable number of elements.

Regards,

Hans
