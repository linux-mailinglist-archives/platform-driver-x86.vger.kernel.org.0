Thanks for the quick and detailed feedback. I agree with your reasoning,
it seems sound.

However, note that this will likely take me some time, as for me kernel
development is purely done as a hobby and it has to fit in between all my
other hobbies such as hiking, etc. Do not mistake radio silence for that I
have given up, just that I don't have much time.

This seems like a good idea indeed.

I have yet to have time to look at it. However this seems to suggest that
these buttons should work when the laptop is off. That is not the case on
the Z830. They only do anything when the computer is on and I can't find
any settings to change that.

Looking at the specification it also mentions several different
notification codes for the button. The only one used on the Z830 is 0x80.
That is, as far as I can tell from the decompilation of the DSDT.

Thus I worry I will not be able to test any sort of generic implementation
very well, if the Z830 only implements a small subset of the functionality.

I guess there is no way to figure out what the buttons are supposed to mean in
this case, and we simply have to leave that to the user to map as they see fit
(as long as the IDs are stable). I'm not sure how well that works with the event
subsystem, as when I test evtest it seems to asign some sort of labels to the
events (e.g. KEY_SLEEP, KEY_BLUETOOTH, ...).

This makes perfect sense, but I don't know if it is guaranteed to be 80%
on all Toshiba laptops. Do you know of any other Toshiba laptops that
have/had this feature, and if so, what the limits are? The Windows driver
for this laptop does not document exactly what the limit is. 80% is simply
what I have observed in practice.

I will test this when I get some time (hopefully at the end of this
weekend, after comming from a multi-day hiking trip).
