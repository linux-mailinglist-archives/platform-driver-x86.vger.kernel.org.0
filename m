The 5.18 merge window starts coming Monday, if you can get me
a v3 with the last few minor items addressed sometime tomorrow,
then I can throw it into my for-next branch and if it does not
cause any issues there then it can make 5.18.

But if anything non trivial pops up while this is baking in -next
I'll probably drop it from -next and then this becomes 5.19 material.

Hans
