But it is a hardware limit, as the hardware will wear and might break if not run 
within its limits.

As this driver is for already released hardware, a firmware fix is not possible.

Currently this driver is for exactly 2 TUXEDO devices (Sirius 16 gen 1 & 2).

Future devices can have different limits provided by the ACPI or a list in the 
driver.

But then the driver still needs to enforce them.

The ACPI interface is only present on TUXEDO devices (TUXI stands for TUXEDO 
Interface and TFAN for TUXEDO FAN). And we want the policy for the devices to 
live longer, not only for warranty.

TUXI meant as a simple getter and setter interface for the EC. We don't have 
access to the EC firmware source so more complex stuff needs to be done 
somewhere else, i.e. the driver.

That's no enforcement as userspace can just write the sysfs directly.
