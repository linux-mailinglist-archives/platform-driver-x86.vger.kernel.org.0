You are right, i misread the decoded bmof buffer xd.

If you do not know for sure which devices _you_ added support the LED interface, then
i would prefer to remove the "num_zones = 2" quirk from those devices for now.

Please send a fix for your quirk entries, so we can avoid forgetting this little detail.

I did not change my mind.

I can understand that most devices either support the original WMAX WMI methods or the AWCC WMI methods,
but from a technical point of view it is still the same device. Also Dell could combine both sets of WMI methods
in a future device, and i would prefer being prepared for that.

We can still split alienware-wmi-wmax into multiple files (which get linked together) later should the source code
of it get too big in the future.

Also having a separate alienware-wmi-legacy would allow users to disable this driver when building the kernel.

I agree, sadly this god object architecture is very common with some hardware manufactures :(

I will base my work on Pali Rohars decoder, but sadly the source code is quite convoluted, so i will
need to do some reverse-engineering.

The decompression alogrithm is already finished:
