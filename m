It's only one data point, but we're seeing adoption of the ACPI
DT-in-DSD for camera. It's still not pretty of course.

I feel your pain. On the camera side, we have a case of an I2C
controller that has a PCI driver in the kernel used when dealing with
the camera sensor, and an AML "driver" used by an I2C GPIO expander,
completely modelled in the DSDT. Both poke the same PCI registers of the
I2C controller. I tried to get information from Intel on how this was
meant to be handled, but I think the people responsible for the design
have been exfiltrated to Guantanamo, or are expiating their sins in a
monastery lost in a mountain.

Once travel will be easier again, we'll plot a take over of the world in
a bar. Dealing with ACPI requires lots of whisky :-)
