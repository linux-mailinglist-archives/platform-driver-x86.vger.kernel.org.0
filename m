Hi,

As usual, first a review of the userspace API.

Note the biggest pending issue with the userspace API is if
we are going to keep this under /sys/devices/platform/dell-wmi-sysman/
or if we are going to have it under:

/sys/class/firmware-attributes/dell-wmi-sysman/

That is still being discussed in the v1 thread.

As discussed in the v1 thread, this is somewhat Dell specific and we make the
sysfs interface generic and move this to /sys/class/firmware-attributes/dell-wmi-sysman/
then this should probably be prefixed with dell- (and moved to a separate section
of this file for vendor extensions to the generic part)

Are value_modifiers only valid for enums? If not this should be moved to
the generic properties (or to the vendor extensions part)

So I know this was mentioned before already but one concern I have here
is that there is a race where other users with write access to say TouchScreen/current_value
may change it between the setting and the clearing of the current_password even if
they don't have the password.

This is esp. relevant with containers. I'm not aware about all the intrinsics of
sysfs and containers, at a minimum we need to check if it is possible to disallow
all writes to the attributes when sysfs is mounted inside a container (so outside of the
main filesystem namespace).

If someone is reading along who happen to knows this, please enlighten me :)

OK, so as also mentioned in the v1 thread, I would like to see the uevent disappear
since it is somewhat of a heavy mechanism and not necessary when userspace specifically
cares about a single sysfs attribute changing.

Instead we can allow userspace to use poll() for POLL_PRI on this file to be notified
when it goes from 0 -> 1. See the v1 thread for some example code how to wake the
poll() in this case.

Regards,

Hans
