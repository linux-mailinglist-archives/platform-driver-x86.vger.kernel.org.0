I completely agree that current_password should be write-only, I don't
see that s a problem.

Well if different schemes are supported and each scheme has its own type,
then I would expect there to be say / e.g.:

/sys/class/firmware-attributes/dell/authentication/admin-password
(with a type of "password") and:
/sys/class/firmware-attributes/dell/authentication/admin-hotp
(with a type of "hotp")

And then the user / userspace can choose which one to use,
I guess if the kernel knows that only hotp has been setup and
there is no standard password set, then it could hide the
/sys/class/firmware-attributes/dell/authentication/admin-password
password.

TBH I think all these things are (mostly) easily solvable if/when we
encounter them. I mean it is definitely good to keep these kind of things
in mind. But at some point we might get lost in all the what-ifs we
can come up with.

If a vendor comes along where authentication is not necessary
for *all* attributes, then we could add the "is_authentication_required"
as an optional sysfs-attribute for the firmware-attributes and state
in the documentation that if that file is lacking that means that
authentication is always required. That way the Dell code would not
even have to have the "is_authentication_required" sysfs-attribute.

Since we also seem to have some trouble to get these 2 properly documented
(I have not looked at v3 yet), I'm fine with making them dell specific by prefixing them
with dell-. I guess that that probably even makes sense.

I can envision similar issues popping up between different generations / models
of Dell hardware even. Specifying what changing the attributes actually does falls
(way) outside of the scope of the sysfs ABI IMHO. That will always be the case
of please consult your Laptop's / Workstation's / Server's manual.
That is actually not much different from the current builtin
firmware setup utility experience where the help text is often,
well, not helpful.

For all I care there is an enum called "HWvirt" with a description of
"Hardware virtualization support" and values of "Enabled" and "Disabled"
which controls something somewhat or even totally different from what the
name and description suggest. That would be less then ideal, but not a problem
from the pov of the sysfs ABI for firmware-attributes. It would be a simple
case of the garbage in garbage out principle.

So this is one problem which I'm happy to punt to userspace and I guess Dell
might do a Dell specific utility, which only works one certain model Dell's,
which is a lot fancier then the basic sysfs functionality and e.g. consumes
the dell-value_modifier and dell-modifier sysfs-attribures.

The purpose behind having a unified userspace ABI is to e.g. allow configuring
firmware settings for a fleet of machines from:

https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/FleetCommander

Using a generic plugin which works across different vendors.

And maybe have a simple vendor-agnostic pygtk3 UI which allows users to
poke at things, even if they have to figure out in which order they need
to change things in some cases (which again is actually not that
different from the current builtin firmware setup utility experience
for a lot of vendors).

I guess a could way to look at the generic sysfs firmware attributes
class I'm proposing is looking at it as a lowest common denominator
solution. With the addition of vendor specific extensions so that
vendors (e.g. Dell) are not limited to only offering functionality
offered by the generic, shared ABI. Does that make sense ?

Regards,

Hans
