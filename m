The driver code is trivial boilerplate, assuming someone doesn't go and
implement a helper to register stuff separately like I suggested.  The
proposed swnode stuff would involve duplicating the DT parsing code.
This seems like a whole lot of effort for something that provides a
worse result than either of the existing things.

To be clear I think that's a terrible idea.

Like I keep saying I think that's a much better approach than trying to
use swnodes, they just seem like a terrible fit for the problem.
