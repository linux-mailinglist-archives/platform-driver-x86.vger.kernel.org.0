Ah, yes - hadn't thought of that. If a driver registered regulators with
those names, it would try to apply those voltages during registration.
Good point.

It is tempting, particularly because (assuming we do end up using this
approach) setting the references to the supplies in a board file like
this complicated the cio2-bridge code quite a bit, since it then needs
to extend the properties array against an already-existing software node
rather than registering a new one. But then, I don't particularly want
to handle that aspect of the problem in two separate places.
