Both drivers have used same entry point and difference as I see that: old
boards return some list of sensors with names, new one always returns zero =
as
count of sensors and requires some hardcoded list of sensors. And list of o=
ld
and new boards is not intersected.=20

As for me, when we have 30% of similar code better have one driver for both
cases. Currently driver has 1126 lines.

(I have not calculated real size of shared code so it can be bigger or less=
.)

Do you like to be in MAINTAINERS list?

Also good news, no EC also will go in next round of updated patches.=20
