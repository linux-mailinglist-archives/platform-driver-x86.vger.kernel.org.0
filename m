Those examples failed to cover the case I was interested in and that 3M 
just happens to exactly be the boundary above which the cases I was asking 
about reside which is why I mentioned it (that 3M is simply derived from 
the numbers in your code, not directly related to the example you gave).

Okay, thanks. I can accept that as you seem to think there's nothing 
wrong with the logic. Not that I'm still entirely convinced since I 
couldn't get an answer to those simple questions I asked about the case 
where dram_size > 3M but it doesn't really matter. (I still need to read
the answer between the lines for the case where dram_size > 3M and that 
message is conflicted.)

But please do explain either in the commit message and/or with a comment 
the purpose of that check because that condition together with the 
surrounding logic looks very suspicious, keeping in mind that when 
somebody reads this bit of code 10 years from now he/she should be able 
understand why you added it there.
