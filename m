Because this interface we want to use is inherently tied to the
workings of x86_64 CPUs. It is very stable and easy to use. The SPI
drivers in contrast have a history of being complex, buggy and in
general not reliable. This module will require very little maintenance
and will probably work in the future without needing modification for
newer platforms. It generally is meant as a fallback to the real SPI
flash drivers so that userspace programs are able to provide essential
functionality.

In a previous mail in June you suggested this is some sort of platform
device, that is why I rewrote it as such. The hardware resource here
is the south bridge for x86_64 CPUs and the module dependencies will
compile it only for these platforms. The situation is like, if you
have that CPU, you have the hardware, so it is implicitly bound or it
just will not execute on a machine code level. I feel like your
requirement is somewhat impossible to satisfy and I really don't know
what to do. Please, can anyone help me by pointing out a proper
example elsewhere in the kernel?
