To be more specific, patch 3 became two separate patches that went through =
drm.

For the rare failure, it would be an additional patch (if appropriate)
that does not affect 1 and 2.

Do you have any idea of where the failure for the other 5% of cases
comes from? I noticed that after I hibernated my device and it booted
up, it would never go into LPS0, the OS hint stopped working, would
that be a hint?
