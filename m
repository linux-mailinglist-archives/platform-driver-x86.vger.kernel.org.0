I know that for some ICs the power sequence can be quite complicated,
but I think that for most this order should work fine:

0. Force enable/reset GPIOs to disabled / reset-asserted (do this at GPIO request time ?)
1. Enable clk(s)
2. Enable regulators (using the bulk API, with supply-names passed
in by the sensor drivers, 
3. Set enable/reset GPIOs to enabled / reset de-asserted

I guess on some models we may need to swap 1 and 2, there could be
a flag for that.

Anything more complicated should just be coded out in the driver, but
I think just supporting this common pattern will already save us
quite a bit of code duplication.

I agree that we should move to runtime-pm and put the power-sequence
in the suspend/resume callback. This will be necessary for any sensors
used on atomisp2 devices, where there are actually ACPI _PS0 and _PS3
methods and/or ACPI power-resources doing the PM for us.

Note for some reason the current staging atomisp driver does not use this,
likely because it was developed for Android boards with broken ACPI
tables. But after having sampled the ACPI tables of a bunch of atomisp
windows devices I believe this should work fine for those.

Regards,

Hans
