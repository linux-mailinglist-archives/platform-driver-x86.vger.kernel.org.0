If you think there is a better approach please let us know, but we figured as this is a Lenovo specific thing it made sense to have it here in thinkpad_acpi.

Ah that is all good to know. That pretty much takes care of
my objections / answers my questions.

Fernando can you please submit a v2 which:

1. Adds documentation as mentioned already
2. Moves the special handling of "XXXXXXXXXXXX" from show()
   to init() (writing to auxmac[] in show() is a bit weird,
   also we only need to do this once, so it is init code)

Regards,

Hans
