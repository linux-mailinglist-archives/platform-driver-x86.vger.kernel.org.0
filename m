Right, this is just shuffling things around a bit because as we get
more and more drivers having them all in one dir becomes a bit
unwieldly.

Ah, no, splitting step 2 as you did into multiple patches is fine,
reviewing multiple small patches typically also is easier. So keeping
the addition of the hp-bioscfg split into multiple patches is good.

The point which I was trying to make is to put all the files
for hp-bioscfg in their own sub-sub-dir and not mix them with
the other driver files in a single hp dir.

Hans
