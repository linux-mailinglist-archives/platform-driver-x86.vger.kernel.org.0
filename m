Thank you for your work on this and thank you for submitting your
driver upstream. It is always good to have support for more laptop
models in the mainline kernel.

And my apologies for being slow with responding to this.

I agree that for performance-mode-cycling handling the hotkey in
the kernel is the right thing to do, this is already done by
several other drivers and we even have a helper for this:
platform_profile_cycle() please make sure you use this helper and
otherwise this is fine.

For kbd-backlight-brightness cycling most laptops actually implement
this in the embedded-controller and we only get an event that
the brightness was changed (with if we are lucky also the new
brightness level inside the event).

As you say we have KEY_KBDILLUMTOGGLE/XF86KbdLightOnOff and
KEY_KBDILLUM[UP|DOWN]/XF86KbdBrightness[Up|Down] but those don't
match what we want here and if we add a new keycode for that
userspace support will also need to be added.

So I think it is best to just emulate what the laptops where
the cycling is directly done by the embedded-control do.

That is:

1. Add LED_BRIGHT_HW_CHANGED to the flags of the led_classdev
for the "xxx:kbd_backlight" led class device you expose

2. Filter out kbd-backlight-cycle keypresses and on such
a keypress:

2.1 Determine new brightness level
2.2 Apply new brightness level
2.3 Call:

led_classdev_notify_brightness_hw_changed(&kbd_backlight_led_classdev, new_brightness_level);

This last call emulates what the kernel reports to userspace
on the events we get from embedded controllers after they have
changed the brightness level based on the cycle-key getting
pressed.

With this in place you should get a nice OSD notification like
for volume up/down in at least GNOME when changing the kbd
backlight level.

Note if you rmmod + modprobe your laptop driver you need
to restart upower afterwards for this to work. IIRC gnome-shell
does not need a logout + login, just restarting upower is enough.
But I might be wrong about not needing to restart gnome-shell...

I hope this helps and I'm looking forward to you submitting
your driver upstream.

Regards,

Hans
