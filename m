Hi all,

More emails came in since I wrote this....but I'm going to send anyway 
and catch up with those after. I need to write faster :)

In all honesty I was slightly dreading this email :) I know the similar 
issue killed our ePrivacy patch...but I fully appreciate that is part of 
open source contribution

So yes - I agree that having a common interface would be a good idea and 
making it common between the vendors makes sense. Let me know how to 
contribute and make that happen.

 From Lenovo's firmware point of view - our three settings should map on 
to this quite closely with the exception that we have one setting that 
covers balance_power and power (I never understood why the FW team did 
that - as they have the four states in Windows - I wasn't able to get a 
satisfactory answer to that question)

Yes and understood. Let me know what is the best place to make this 
happen - from my point of view the main aim is to get this to our users 
to make the whole performance mode implemetnation more usable and 
obvious. Without my proposed patch it's really hard to tell what mode 
you are in on our platforms (and leads to lots of support questions).

I'm particularly aware of the eprivacy patch where that got rejected for 
a generic solution that was under development - but the person working 
on the generic solution stopped part way through to work on other 
things. We didn't have the knowledge or experience of the graphics 
driver to be able to really go and contribute effectively so for now 
that feature is dead even though our initial patch was fairly simple. It 
is still disappointing that our users don't get useful functionality 
(and I also have to argue with marketing as to whether we can sell Linux 
systems with ePrivacy screens which is no fun - I spend way too much of 
my life doing Lenovo internal paperwork).

I figure on this item it's less complicated (not tied into the graphics 
drivers details) so I hope I can contribute more directly - let me know 
if I'm being naive.

One question - the main reason for a common interface is for user space 
to not deal with a mess of APIs. Is it worth me doing a simplified 
version of my patch (maybe using debugfs?) so I can expose the modes to 
users whilst we work on the common solution? I'm assuming there is no 
mileage in getting my patch (with the fix I owe Benjamin) in and then 
changing it in the future once the generic solution is available as that 
potentially messes up userspace too much? Something as a stopgap measure 
that won't annoy the kernel community but is good for Linux users as I'm 
guessing the generic solution is likely to be months away

Let me know what you recommend as the next steps.

I'm good with this too - but the lapmode patch is accepted and there is 
the palm sensor patch too which I'm hoping is accepted soon. Whilst I'm 
happy to make them part of this implementation (if they fit) I'd 
appreciate if they didn't get removed or held up as they're needed for 
our WWAN implementation which is already overdue.
The main consumer there will be our WWAN enablement utility and we can 
change that to support different API if needs be :)
