Perhaps, but usually WMI methods take the locks which they need on entry and
release them on exit. I'm not even sure if an ACPI method (which this
ultimately is) can hold locks after it exits, I would not be surprised if a=
ll
acquired locks are automatically dropped on exit from the interpreter.

Also note that the README also states that on some motherboards the problems
are fixed in later BIOS versions, which also points to a race inside the AML
code and not a bug in the driver.

I did not check, but this should not matter, that may mess up the driver's
state, but the WMI code is expected to do its own locking at the AML level,=
 to
e.g. protect against similar accesses to the super IO through the ACPI ther=
mal
region interface.

Note I'm not claiming that this is definitely not an issue with the driver,=
 it
could be. But I've seen a lot of very buggy AML code and I've yet to find a
single vendor which does not write very low quality AML code. It seems ther=
e is
absolutely no code-review done on the AML code and very little QA.
