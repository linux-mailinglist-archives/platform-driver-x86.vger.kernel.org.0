I have another idea:

rename alienware-wmi.c -> alienware-alienfx.c
create alienware-wmi-wmax.c

Both independent modules that can be included/excluded with config
parameters, etc. alienware-alienfx would register the platform driver
and the wmi legacy device driver, while alienware-wmi-wmax would do
everything independently and only register an "alienware-wmi" platform
device if loaded on a 'legacy' laptop model.

Of course I'd make sure a platform device with the same name is not loaded
twice.

Something about this doesn't feel right but I don't know what it is.
However it is less files and less memory footprint, because ideally,
'legacy' code would not even load on newer models. 

I thought about this because Mario said legacy interface is only
supported by a handful of devices and it seems like a waste of resources
to load unsupported interfaces.
