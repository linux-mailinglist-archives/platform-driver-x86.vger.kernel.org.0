In my opinion, Fn-lock mode is related to input subsystem and should be
probably reported via input device. For a user, fn-lock is similar like
caps-lock, scroll-lock or num-lock. Also fn-lock is provided by other
laptops and therefore I would expect that kernel provide fn-lock state
for all laptops (thinkpad / latitude / ...) via same interface. And not
via dell-specific interface or general-vendor-message interface.

Wrong power adapter sounds like something related to power subsystem.
Adding Sebastian to the loop, maybe he can provide some useful ideas
about it.

And plugged dock into wrong port. This is probably dell-specific event
and some interface for "vendor" messages from kernel to userspace would
be needed to deliver such things.
