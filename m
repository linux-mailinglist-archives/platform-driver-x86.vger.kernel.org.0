Ok, so this means that if we go with these changes as currently
proposed that if a user uses the sysfs file to turn CnQF on/off
they will need to restart power-profile-daemon.

I think that that is acceptable given that the user needs to manually
poke things anyway. We should probably document this in the documentation
for the sysfs attribute (as well as in newer versions of the p-p-d
docs/README).

Right.

Yes that was my understanding too.

AMD folks, please correct me if any of the below is wrong:

AFAIK even though it is called CnQF it is more like auto-profile
selection and as such does not take user intent into account
at all.

It looks at the workload over a somewhat longer time period (say
5 minutes or so I guess?) and then if that consistently has been
quite high, it will select something similar to performance.

Where as for a more mixed workload it will select balanced and for
a mostly idle machine it will select low-power.

I guess this auto feature is best treated the same as unsupported hw.

Even though it is called cool and quiet AFAIK it won't be all that
cool and quiet when running a heavy workload. Which is why I wonder
how to re-conciliate this with showing low-power in e.g. the
GNOME shell system men. Because in essence even if the battery
is low the system will still go full-throttle when confronted
with a heavy workload.

So selecting low-power would result in the screen-dimming which
I think is part of that, but the CPU's max power-consumption won't
get limited as it would when platform-profiles are supported.

So I guess this is indeed very much like how p-p-d behaves
on unsupported hw...

###

As mentioned I guess one option would be for CnQF to
still register a platform_profile provider and then in
balanced mode do its CnQF thing and in low-power mode
disable CnQF and apply the static-slider low-power settings
I think that that would work best from things actual
working in a way I would expect the avarage end-user to
expect things to work.

So p-p-d would then still see platform-profile support
in CnQF mode but with only low-power + balanced advertised.

Bastien would that work for you?

AMD folks would that also work for you ?

###

I'm also wondering if we are going to still export
balanced + low-power modes to userspace in CnQF mode
and disable CnQF in low-power mode then if we
even need a sysfs knob to turn it on/off at all.

I guess the sysfs knob would then still be useful
to turn it on on systems where it defaults to off
in the BIOS.  Might be better to do this as
a kernel-cmdline (module-param) then though, then we
also avoid the problem of platform_profile support
all of a sudden changing underneath's p-p-d's feet.

Hans
