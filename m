We will have multiples of each platform device. So for example we can
have multiple OOBMSM in each system and each OOBMSM may have multiple
telemetry regions and maybe one crashlog.

In addition to just the binary sysfs we need to expose several other
fields including the GUID, the size, and controls for enabling,
disabling, and either triggering or checking to see if the crashlog
has already been triggered. As such we would end up with a folder per
device and the binary sysfs would probably be living in the folder.

The reason why I bring them up is because there are cases for
telemetry where the applications will likely want to be able to just
memory map the region and poll on certain statistics. So if nothing
else we may end up supporting both a mmap and a read option.

The binary sysfs isn't that much of a concern for me other than the
fact that it eliminates the character devices. The
cdev_add/device_create path is fairly simple to put together and
worked for the setup. However in switching to a binary sysfs I need to
create something similar to the folder that was created before and
then insert the binary sysfs file there. I have only done a bit of
sysfs work so I am not familiar with what is involved in setting that
up and need to spend some time trying to grok the code.

Thanks.
