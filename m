Yes, it's been added on v8. 0x5d is init for the laptops it is
problematic for. Not because it does not work, but because it has not
been verified to work for those laptops.

This driver is only used for Ally devices. If you mean that people
remap their keyboards using inputplumber I guess they could but I have
not seen it.

Users see the name of their devices in their settings menu. They
should be accurate. Also, the early entry needs to be added anyway to
prevent kicking devices.

My tool never checked for names, it briefly did for around a month
after its creation for some devices until capability matches. Around
6.1 and 6.7 the kernel changed the names of most USB devices and that
caused issues. It currently only uses name matches for VID/PID 0/0
devices created by the kernel. Specifically, WMI and AT Keyboards. I
am not sure there is a workaround for those. Asusctl also does not use
names either.

These changes are not doing something extraordinary. It's just a minor clea=

Well, this series is needed to account for that. Sending the disable
command is out of scope for now though.
