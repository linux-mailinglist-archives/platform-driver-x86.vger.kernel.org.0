That is an interesting proposal, but this happens really early on and for s=
ome
devices _HID / _CID is not just an ACPI Name() field but an actual Method w=
hich
does a bunch of things, like e.g. checking GPIOs to see which touchscreen/p=
ad
model is installed.=20

Although it is unlikely to encounter such _CID / _HID methods on devices
directly under _SB, it cannot be ruled out, so calling _CID + _HID for all
devices under _SB seems unwise.

Also note that these patches still need to change a bit, as I mentioned they
cause trouble on a X1C8. I've a plan for this which I plan to implement tod=
ay
and then I'll send out a RFC series to the linux-acpi list (and also attach=
 it
here for Johannes to test the new version).
