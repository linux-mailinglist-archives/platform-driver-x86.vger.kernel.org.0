We have an ODM that was willing to include ACPI code by us in their BIOS blob 
and we hope that in the future we can carry that API over to other ODMs for 
future TUXEDO devices.

In pseudocode that API looks like this:

v1:

void SMOD(bool mode): Toggle firmware controlled fans vs manually (aka via the 
commands below) controlled fans
bool GMOD(): Get current SMOD setting
int GCNT(): Get number of fans
enum GTYP(int index): Returns "CPU-fan" or "GPU-fan"
void SSPD(int index, int value): Set fan speed target as a fraction of max speed
int GSPD(int index): Get current fan speed target as a fraction of max speed

v2 same as v1 but with added:

int GRPM(int index): Get current actual fan speed in revolutions per minute
int GTMP(int index): Get temperature of thing fan with respective index is 
pointed at (CPU or GPU die, see GTYP)

Like I said, what is missing is a "Get Max RPM" function even in v2, which we 
might add a future iteration, but, well this bios is now out in the wild. 
However these released devices have a "get info" function in the wmi code which 
returns the v2 infos and the max rpm.

I want to write the code in a way that it probes the acpi interface for function 
existence and wherever something is missing tries to fall back to infos gathered 
from the wmi interface, but that one is implemented in a stand alone module (the 
tuxedo_nb04_* stuff in tuxedo-drivers) and I would like to keep it that way in 
honor of KISS.

My plan is that the first time max rpm is pulled the acpi driver uses 
bus_find_device_* to get the wmi device, if present, and pulls max rpm from the 
driver data there and copies it over to it's own driver data. If not possible it 
returns a dummy value or falls back to another method. Maybe a hard coded list 
of max rpm values, currently only 2 devices have the new interface, so it 
wouldn't be a long list. Directly going to the hard coded list is our current 
fallback plan, but it is not an elegant solution as the info is actually there, 
if you know what i mean?

Kind regards,

Werner
