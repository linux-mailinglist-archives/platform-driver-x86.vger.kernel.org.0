In my experience it is best to pick one approach of

1. Deliver event to userspace and let userspace handle everything
2. Handle everything in kernel and stick with that

We actually have what you are suggesting for display brightness
up/down presses in the drivers/acpi/acpi_video.c driver
which exposes both a /sys/class/backlight device and an evdev
device delivering key-press events and which automatically
increases the brightness of the /sys/class/backlight device on
brightness up/down hotkey presses.

And that combination is a hot mess. GNOME/KDE see the keypress
and then race with the kernel increasing the brightness. Typically
they loose the race reading the new brigthness increasing the
brightness by 2 steps on one keypress. And some older laptops
have only 8 steps, so that is a problem.

I disabled the in kernel handling of the brightness up/down
keypresses in the ACPI video bus driver because of this, but
some users complained about this breaking old X11 setups using
e.g. Window Maker of fvwm. Linus Torvalds ended up "fixing"
this by instead of having the kernel immediately react giving
userspace like 0.25 seconds or something to respond and if
it does not, then handle it in the kernel. Which of course
is racy so sometimes users still hit the 2 steps for one
keypress issue if the laptop is under load.

Note this is meant as an example of what NOT to do.

As for the hwdb mapping of they keypress to unknown I predict
that at some point a well intending user is going to notice
this, map it to KEY_KBDILLUMTOGGLE and submit a PR to systemd
upstream.  Then the systemd upstream maintainers will trust
this user, who actually has such a laptop which they don't to
be doing the right thing and merge it.

And then if GNOME/KDE/xxxx grow support for actually acting
on KEY_KBDILLUMTOGGLE (if they do not do so already) we have
the kernel hotkey and userspace hotkey handling fighting
each other just like the example above.

So based on this I would strongly advice you to filter out
the key event completely at the kernel level.

If someone ever really needs / wants that event then my
suggestion would be to add a module option which *completely*
disables all in kernel handling for the key in kernelspace
and instead delivers the events to userspace.

TL;DR: IMHO mixing in kernel handling with keypress reporting
is a bad idea. Please chose one model and stick with it.

IMHO, the best way to solve this issue is to tell users to do
"rmmod samsung_galaxybook" instead of modprobe -r. And you can do
the same in any Makefiles / scripts you may have.
