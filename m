The whole idea behind the 101 possible profiles setup is to make the
API flexible/extensible. We don't know how much other profiles other
implementations will offer, nor what the naming used by that vendor
will be. So offering a fixed list in advance is sort of impossible.

For p-p-d the descriptions are probably not interesting at all,
but I think it would still be good for the driver to list the
Windows names of the various profiles in the mappings file.

Well Benjamin made a very valid point that we need to be able to
sort the various profiles along the low-power <-> performance axis
and maybe even also show some relative distance if some options
are closer together then others.  Which lead to (Bejamin's) 0-100
idea. I think this makes a lot of sense as it should give us
enough flexibility to cover other x86 vendor's implementations
and hopefully also similar functionality on other architectures.

I agree that this is slightly more complicated then I initially
expected too, but that is the price of building in some much
needed flexibility.  If you have options to simplify the interface
though I'm all ears.

Regards,

Hans
