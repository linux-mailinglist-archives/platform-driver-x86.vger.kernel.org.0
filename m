Hi,

Thank you for the review.

Well the normal grepping for log messages argument does not really apply
here and making this one long line would be pretty unreadable IMHO, so I'm
going to keep this as is.

Something like that yes, there are some hints that this is a bitfield in
the Android driver code, but then in other places it seems to be more of
a command structure then just individual bits having a meaning.

All in all we really don't know, so I'm going to keep this as just
an opaque array of bytes, because that is really what it is / what we know
about it.

hehe, the driver is somewhat large, I've tried to group various
sub bits, like keyboard handling, touchpad handling, etc. together.

These are dividers for the different groups, which is why I gave them
a different style then normal comments.
