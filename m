Unfortunately, this is how the feature is called in Windows. On both
OneXPlayer and Ayaneo. Manufacturers are centralizing around that
term.

Under the hood, it should be bypassing the charger circuitry, but it
is not obvious during use. The user behavior mirrors `inhibit-charge`,
as the battery just stops charging, so the endpoint is appropriate.

The previous versions of this patch used the charge_type endpoint.
However, it does not have autodetection, so it needs to be hardcoded
[1].

There is also an ayaneo-platform out-of-tree driver with a PR for that
endpoint, which is where I found out about it [2]. So I thought it
would be more appropriate.

I can rewrite the commit message to not include the word bypass.

I tried to be minimal. If we want to make the name longer, I vote for
"inhibit-charge-awake". I can spin a v5 with that.

The device does not charge while asleep. Only when it is off.

This is handled by the device when it comes to OneXPlayer. No driver
changes are needed.
