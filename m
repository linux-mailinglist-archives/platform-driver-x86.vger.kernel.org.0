At that is good to know.

Yes this is till a problem on at least the hp-pavilion-cx-0598na, see
the mail thread starting here:

https://lore.kernel.org/platform-driver-x86/CAGTBY+sgwYrDPtQgJV=TcXJ73n8TGf9Nw=arCfWMUrVFzAsEVQ@mail.gmail.com/

I've just asked the reported of that problem to check if there is a BIOS
update for his system.

Regards,

Hans
