No, let's not take this approach.

Every alternate mode a connector supports will need to have its own
"sub-fwnode" under the connector fwnode. I thought we agreed this
earlier?

In any case, those sub-nodes will have default device properties named
"svid" and "vdo". If the alternate mode still needs some other
details, it can have other device properties that are specific to it,
but note that displayport alt mode does not need anything extra. The
"vdo" will already tells which pin configurations the connector
supports and that is all that the driver needs to know.

After we have the sub-nodes, it's not a big deal to walk through the
child-nodes the port has during port registration and register the
port alternate modes at the same time. That we can do in
typec_register_port(), so we do not need to do it in every driver
separately.


thanks,
