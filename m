Thanks again Armin for all of the very detailed comments -- they are
always super helpful!! A few things I think are pretty obvious and I
agree with, as well as where I missed as copy/paste when moving around
stuff that you caught (great!), so I will not bother to respond to
those here and will instead just fix them. :) For other things where I
have some questions, I will respond inline below.

I guess I am a bit confused by the intention and usage
firmware-attributes in general (including what should be in this
documentation vs not) -- is the idea that these should be "relatively
generic" attributes that control settings in the firmware that can
persist across reboots and or steer the firmware/hardware in various
ways (e.g. with admin password and/or pending reboot status etc) ? And
if they are "relatively generic" (e.g. could be reused by more than
one platform driver) then would the documentation belong here in a
centralized place? Otherwise, if they are device-specific, why would
they not be device attributes (e.g. via dev_groups for example),
instead of firmware-attributes?

Here I am a bit confused on exactly how this would/should look; all
existing usages of fw_attr_class I can see use exactly this same
pattern: device_create() and then device_destroy() with MKDEV(0, 0).
Taking a look at the latest proposed changes from Thomas and it stil
seems the intention is the same, just that it is slightly simplified
and use pointer to the firmware_attributes_class directly instead of
fetching it using fw_attributes_class_get(). Or is there a better way
to do this (including usage of device_unregister() and/or something
different with the devt) that will help solve some other problem(s)?

I guess as a follow-on to my earlier question regarding
firmware-attributes; here I was assuming that as these are very simple
"on vs off" attributes, I used the attribute "pending_reboot" as a
pattern for what I implemented here as my "best guess" on what to do
:) As there are not very many examples to look at then it was a bit of
a "best guess" on my part; apologies if I completely missed the boat!
I can of course add these entire groups but IMHO it does seem like
quite a bit of overkill to have all of these various attributes for
on/off or enabled/disabled kind of boolean switches -- my guess is
that if it is somehow "known" that an attribute is a boolean, then it
is relatively self-explanatory and the need for current / default /
possible_values etc attributes within this enumeration type group
should not be needed?  (this is why I followed "pending_reboot" as a
pattern when I did this, but as said I can change this to whatever is
deemed appropriate).

Also there are several other platform drivers that implement a very
similar device attribute as ones that I have added here as a firmware
attribute (namely I am thinking of "USB Charging" which exists in
several other pdx86 drivers but a few other devices should/would
probably support this kind of "Power on Lid Open" attribute as well);
in the event that maintainers of those drivers should and eventually
do migrate over to use the same or similar firmware attribute for this
same kind of setting, should it include all of these attributes in the
standard "enumeration" type attribute group or is it possible / would
it make sense to have some sort of boolean-based fw attr type that is
a bit more simple and a bit more self-explanatory?

No (and I tested again to confirm), this "block recording" ACPI
setting does not persist over reboots. Should this one be a device
attribute (e.g. via dev_groups) instead of a firmware attribute in
that case?

This whole thing was a bit "tricky" and the reason why I built the
logic in the way I did is that there are so many variations in these
devices which have different modes enabled depending on the hardware
and what generation (keep in mind that there are around 20-30
different models as of this writing that work with this driver and
many of them have slight variations on what hardware exists and/or
which modes are supported for various features including this
"performance mode"!).

For background, here is the original GitHub issue where I worked with
my community to initially go from hard-coded modes to dynamic based on
response from the ACPI method which gives the list of "supported
modes": https://github.com/joshuagrisham/samsung-galaxybook-extras/issues/31

Basically, some devices only have 2 "actively used" performance modes,
some have 3, and some have 4. Some devices only have the "legacy"
modes, but newer devices report (according to the ACPI method +
payload that responds with "supported modes" on said device) to
support BOTH the "legacy" and the "newer" modes, but in Windows they
are only using the new modes, while "legacy" modes are ignored by the
Samsung-developed apps and services in Windows.

The response from the "supported performance modes" method gives the
total number of supported "modes" followed by a list of each of them,
and will look something like this (using enum names here to hopefully
help make more sense, but leaving out my prefix "PERFORMANCE_MODE_"
for brevity...):

On my "Pro" Galaxy Book, it looks like this:

6 (# of supported modes), OPTIMIZED_LEGACY, PERFORMANCE_LEGACY,
OPTIMIZED, QUIET, SILENT, PERFORMANCE

Because I have seen that upower + GNOME integration does not even
really work unless you have all three of low-power + balanced +
performance available, then my goal was to map the above modes to
these profiles:

PERFORMANCE -> performance
OPTIMIZED -> balanced
QUIET -> quiet
SILENT -> low-power

(and, just as in Windows, ignore the "legacy" modes as I have a valid
non-legacy mode to cover each different one)

On the "Ultra" line of Galaxy Books, it looks like this:

6, OPTIMIZED_LEGACY, PERFORMANCE_LEGACY, OPTIMIZED, QUIET, PERFORMANCE, ULTRA

(so no SILENT, but add an ULTRA...)

In this case, in order to ensure to map at least low-power + balanced
+ performance and fit the rest in between, I would want:

ULTRA -> performance
PERFORMANCE -> balanced-performance
OPTIMIZED -> balanced
QUIET -> low-power

Both of these examples match exactly how these devices also work in
Windows with Samsung's own developed applications and services.
Namely, that when the newer modes exist, they use them instead of the
"legacy" modes even though the ACPI method includes all of them as
"supported." I think it would be good to maintain this behavior, as
these are the values which Samsung is supporting already in Windows
and the others are potentially untested and I would worry about
potential issues including overheating or otherwise harming the device
in some way.

In cases where only the "legacy" modes exist, then those are the modes
that are used in Windows (e.g. for some devices with SAM0427) and the
ACPI method does not respond with anything except the legacy mode
values. Some of the SAM0427 devices I have seen can look like this,
for example:

5, OPTIMIZED_LEGACY, PERFORMANCE_LEGACY, QUIET, SILENT, PERFORMANCE

In this case, we want to map like this:

PERFORMANCE -> performance
OPTIMIZED_LEGACY -> balanced
QUIET -> quiet
SILENT -> low-power

(using OPTIMIZED_LEGACY for balanced, as OPTIMIZED does not exist on
this device, but there is a non-legacy mode for all of the others that
should be used)

So, with all of that background in mind, my idea and what I
implemented was to basically take the list provided in response from
the ACPI method, start from the end, looping backwards, and try to map
them one-at-a-time, all the while checking if the desired profile for
the given performance mode was already mapped or not, and if so,
either "fitting it in" to another profile or just ignoring it.

I am quite certain that the code can be cleaned up and/or refactored a
bit, but I would hope that the result of the logic should stay the
same (per what I described above); having said all of that, does it
still make sense to try and simplify this somehow and/or any tips or
recommendation how to achieve the desired result in a better way?

When I looked at this originally I thought it would make sense to do
this, but then found that this function is not part of leds.h in the
kernel headers but instead you would have to include both
<linux/leds.h> and also  "../../leds/leds.h" as a file header from the
tree. Also, apart from led-core, there is only one LED driver that
uses the function currently .. does this seem reasonable to include
this extra file-based header or would it make more sense to just read
the value of the member directly as all of the other drivers that need
to do this work currently?

(FWIW I did test to include this header file and it works fine to use
the function instead, it just feels a bit "off"...)

Yes I think this makes sense as well and is what I will do in the next
version in case your patch to pass a context pointer to i8042 filter
does not go before then :)

Yes it has taken me a few days to get back and dig into this again due
to the holidays, but am looking through it all again and will
hopefully have a new version soon-ish to try and resolve more of the
open issues. Thank you again for all of your help!!
