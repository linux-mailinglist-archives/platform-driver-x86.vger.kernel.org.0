I can't really vouch for high end desktop motherboards, but at least as far=
 as
laptops are concerned this has been the case since forever about everywhere
(ranging from "somewhat nitpicky" lacks to "kinda important" ones)

I don't know how dangerous accessing EC could be (be it directly, or through
possible ACPI methods.. in some cases datasheets may even be available), but
something else that isn't just vanilla WMI is needed.=20

Btw following the breadcrumb trail of the asus linux drivers history.. it s=
eems
like different/older machines may have used 'ECRW' in its place (or if not =
any
I found that to still be present on my 2016 X756UX).
