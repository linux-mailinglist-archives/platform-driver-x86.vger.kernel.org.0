All of this doesn't really sound like it is more maintainable. It
requires the base use case, being able to read the BIOS/UEFI binary
plus more code and a more complicated interface. So if you do this,
there's more cats out of the bag.
Also please be aware that not everything is UEFI and you would
probably need to support things like CoreBoot as well.
