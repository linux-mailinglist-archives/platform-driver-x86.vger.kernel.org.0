Well, you can do that from OFW too. E.g.:

  " console=ttyS2,115200" to boot-file

I'm using [1].

[1] https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hackerspace/olpc-xo175-linux/lr/olpc-xo175/arch/arm/configs/olpc_xo175_defconfig

I'm wondering if it would make sense to include this upstream?
My guess was that nowadays multi_v7_defconfig that just works
on any DT-based platform is preferred to machine specific ones.

However, this one would enable OLPC-specific drivers the
multi_v7_defconfig defconfig wouldn't.

I've sent out an update to multi_v7_defconfig [2]. Once it is applied,
it should work on the XO-1.75 (without fancy things like camera or
power button).

Yes. OFW loads olpc.fth from the first active FAT or ext3 partition on
SD card or a USB flash drive. If you put the zImage in the same place,
the following script would work:
  
  \ OLPC boot script

  " last:\zImage" to boot-device
  visible unfreeze
  boot

Note that it has to start with a backslash. The "visible" and "unfreeze"
words enable the DCON pass-through mode. You would see the XO logo
instead of the actual screen output without it.

> Is there some kind of documentation somewhere? :-).

This is always a tough question. Short answer would be no.

I'm happy to answer questions though, if the above wouldn't be
sufficient to make the thing boot for you.

I'd prefer if things just worked to documenting how to hack things
to make them work. If you got a Fedora machine, you can already
just pick a nightly [1] armhfp image and install it with
fedora-arm-installer the same way as any other ARM machine. I hope
to make Debian work too. An image that already boots would then
hopefully be a good start for whoever wishes to run their own kernels.
That's my excuse for not documenting things...
