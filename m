No problem. But these patches are not child device drivers. They take
the existing intel_pmt MFD code and split it from the device driver
(similar to how intel-lpss core code is split from the acpi and pci bus
drivers). There are 2 drivers now, PMT-only and OOBMSM, that use a
common MFD API. This is why they all reside in MFD in this patchset.
But I could move the API callers to platform/x86.

But I'd like feedback on whether this split is even needed. I'm trying
to manage the fact that one of the devices in intel_pmt will now need
support for new, non-PMT, child devices. So there would be a mismatch
between what the driver and Kconfig are named vs what it actually
supports. I considered adding all the new cells to intel_pmt and
renaming the driver to something more generic, but I understand this
will be messy for OSVs managing Kconfig options. Thanks.
