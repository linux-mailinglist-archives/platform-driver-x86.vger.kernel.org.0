That will not work though for legacy devices if e.g. both
are builtin and the acpi.c code gets to register its
driver first. In that case the legacy code will fail to
register its driver, even though it is the one which should
be used.

Same happens if the acpi.c and plat.c code both are modules
but acpi.c is (manually) loaded first on a legacy platform.

Those are fine.

Ack, the combination of rename of the driver + the above check
should fix things.

Great, thank you. Note you need to keep the mutex locked
for almost the entire code flow in hsmp_acpi_probe() (until
is_probed = true is done).

Please consider using:

	guard(mutex)(&hsmp_pdev->mutex);

in hsmp_acpi_probe() directly after getting hsmp_dev, this
this avoids the need to manual unlock the mutex.

Note the mutex will be a new addition to struct hsmp_plat_device,
currently this has no mutex.

And this will need to use a static mutex initializer.

Regards,

Hans
