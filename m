dell-wmi is just listener for events delivered by WMI interface. All
events are currently delivered only via input device to userspace as
most of the events are key pressed or other similar events which maps to
input device. Looking at the code, there is one exception about event
KEY_KBDILLUMTOGGLE which is delivered to dell-laptop driver to notify it
when dell firmware itself decided to change keyboard backlight level.

For two Dell laptops (Dell Inspiron M5110 and Dell Vostro V131) it is
needed to call special SMBIOS function to enable receiving those WMI
events. Therefore dell-wmi checks via DMI table if that special call is
required then use dell-smbios-base module to issue needed call.

So theoretically if some key press events are not delivered on
particular dell laptop, it is a good idea to add it on that
dell_wmi_smbios_list, special SMBIOS call would be issued and check if
something is changed... But for now we know only 2 laptops which
required it (or better only 2 people complained that not all key press
events are delivered and verified that special SMBIOS call was
required).
