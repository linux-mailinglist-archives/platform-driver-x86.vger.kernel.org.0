Do you think it's worth keeping around the sysfs-class-power-dell
file? At this point it's basically just documenting the slight naming
differences:


                Standard:
                        Fully charge the battery at a moderate rate.
                Fast:
                        Quickly charge the battery using fast-charge
                        technology. This is harder on the battery than
                        standard charging and may lower its lifespan.
                        The Dell BIOS calls this ExpressCharge=E2=84=A2.
                Trickle:
                        Users who primarily operate the system while
                        plugged into an external power source can extend
                        battery life with this mode. The Dell BIOS calls
                        this "Primarily AC Use".
                Adaptive:
                        Automatically optimize battery charge rate based
                        on typical usage pattern.
                Custom:
                        Use the charge_control_* properties to determine
                        when to start and stop charging. Advanced users
                        can use this to drastically extend battery life.

                Access: Read, Write
                Valid values:
                              "Standard", "Fast", "Trickle",
                              "Adaptive", "Custom"
