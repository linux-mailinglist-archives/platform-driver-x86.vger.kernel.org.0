Note to others following this thread I asked Luke to clarify this
a bit in an unrelated 1:1 conversation we were having:

I see, so the old (still present) mono-color "asus::kbd_backlight"
brightness works as a master brightness control and the rgb values
in the ASUS_WMI_DEVID_TUF_RGB_MODE WMI set commands are really
just to set the color.

And I guess that the Fn + whatever kbd brightness hotkey also still
modifies the old mono-color "asus::kbd_backlight"? Which means that
the "asus::kbd_backlight" device is also the device on which the
led_classdev_notify_brightness_hw_changed is done as you mention
below.

Right to me this not being able to read back the values shows that
the firmware API here really is not suitable for doing a more
fancy "nice" / standard sysfs API on top.

Since we cannot read back any of the r, g, b, mode or speed values
we would need to pick defaults and then setting any of them would
override the actual values the hw is using for the others, which
is really not a good thing to do.

So that only leaves something akin to keyboard_rgb_mode[_index] +
keyboard_rgb_state[_index] which sets all values at once, mirroring
the limited WMI API as a good option here, I agree with you on this.

Sorry Pavel, I know you don't like custom sysfs attributes
being added to LED class devices, but I have to agree with Luke
that there really is not a good way to deal with this here and
we did try!

Only request I have for the next version wrt the decision to
circle all the way back to having:

> - keyboard_rgb_mode, WO = "n n n n n n"
> - keyboard_rgb_mode_index, output = "save/apply, mode, r, g, b, speed"
> - keyboard_rgb_state, WO = "n n n n n"

Is please put these new attributes under the:
/sys/class/leds/asus::kbd_backlight

Using the led_class_device.groups member as discussed before, now
that we have decided to drop the multicolor LED stuff that should
work :)

Although maybe Pavel prefers to have the new sysfs attributes
under /sys/bus/platform/devices/asus-nb-wmi/ instead since they
are non standard.

Pavel, to me having these under /sys/class/leds/asus::kbd_backlight
seems more logical. But since there are non-standard and since
there already is a bunch of asus-wmi sysfs API under
/sys/bus/platform/devices/asus-nb-wmi/ putting them there if you
prefer that is fine with me too. So what do you prefer ?

Ack, see above. Thank you for at least trying to use the multi-color
LED API.

Hans
