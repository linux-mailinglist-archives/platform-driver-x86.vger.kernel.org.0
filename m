At least for all the Gigabyte ACPI tables I have looked at all access is done
via two-byte "OperationRegion" over the Index/Data addresses, a "Field" with
two entries for these and an "IndexField" that is actually used to perform the
accesses.
As the IndexField is synchronized via "Lock" it should take a lock on the
OperationRegion itself.

So I think we should be technically fine with validating these assumption and
then also taking locks on the OperationRegion.

If it is reasonable to do so is another question.

Are both of these chips available at the two well-known registers 0x2e and
0x4e?

Would this too-long blocking also occur when only accessing single registers
for read-only access?
Any write access would probably have to be blocked anyways.
