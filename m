If Ilpo and Hans agree to extend the scope of the firmware-attribute class to also cover non-persistent
firmware settings then i will not resist.

Excuse me for asking a stupid question here, but what WMI interfaces exactly are we currently arguing about?

Regarding the firmware-attributes: if Ilpo and Hans give their OK, then i see no problems in using the firmware-attribute class for
non-persistent firmware settings. I for my part would be OK with such a change.

Regarding the enforcement of firmware limits: i believe that caching those limits during probing would solve the performance problem.
If users want to override those limits when we can add a module param (marked as unsafe to taint the kernel if used) later which tells
the driver to ignore those limits when writing firmware settings.

Any important points which i missed?

Thanks,
Armin Wolf
