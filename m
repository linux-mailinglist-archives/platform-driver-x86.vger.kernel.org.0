Right, so then a userspace process can write "Discharging" to the status
property to enable "forced discharge" mode, I get that.

And from then on any reads of status will read "Discharging" but how
does (another) userspace process now differentiate this forced
"Discharging" from normal discharging ? It cannot differentiate the
2 unless we add a new "Forced Discharging" status string which
comes with the problem of current userspace not being prepared to
deal with this status string.

Which IMHO makes this idea of overloading / adding this new usage
to status a not so great API, this seems like something which
the status attribute was never intended for.

I agree that this is a weak argument, but when possible solutions
are otherwise mostly equal, then easy and especially also cleanliness
of implementation definitely comes into play. We don't have an
infinite amount of developer time (the opposite actually).

Right, force-discharge automatically implies charging is
being inhibited, so putting this in one file makes sense.

Any suggestion for the name of the file ?
