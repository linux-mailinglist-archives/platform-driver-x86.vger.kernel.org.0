As I said before:
The DMI contains a table of firmware scancode to linux keycode mappings.
this is parsed at boot and used together with the bios_to_linux_keycode
entries & dell_wmi_keymap_type_ tables to create a keymap.

If a DMI entry does not have a corresponding entry in bios_to_linux_keycode
we log a message to allow adding the correct linux keycode if known.
This is regardless of if the key actually exists on the device.

To date, I have not been able to generate this keycode on my computer.

Probably so, but i have no way of knowing.

I just don't think there is a point spamming a users log with info that
they can't do anything with. If this is turned into a debug print then
i don't care to leave this as is, i had thought this might be helpful
just to know that this keycode mapping appears in the wild.
