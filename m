When I saw recently that you added lid switch support and I've got my hopes=
 up
in believing that at least that piece was fixed. Then I remembered that it
unfortunately doesn't work under Ryzen 4000+ devices. I thought that the is=
sue
was on asus_nb_wmi driver, but there is no data for the lid sensor, I've ju=
st
recently confirmed when I had a copy of Windows and removed the AMD UMDF Se=
nsor
driver. The automatic keyboard disabler was gone.

Essentially with the upstream kernel driver I have accelerometer data, but =
no
lid switch. With yours unfortunately I haven't both.

I don't really get why they can't release documentation on this device if t=
hey
do not want to support in Linux properly, frankly.

Hope that someone will be able to fix it,

Marco.
