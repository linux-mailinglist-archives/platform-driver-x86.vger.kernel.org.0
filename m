As I said I'm really not sure. So if nobody would complain then you can
let it as is.

You can use ./scripts/checkpatch.pl application which is in git tree,
which does basic checks for code style. It cannot prove if something is
really correct but it can prove if something is incorrect.

Yes, I hope so.

I have not looked at the battery_hook_register() code yet (seems that I
would have to properly read it and understand it). But does it mean that
battery_hook_register() is adding hook just for "BAT0"?

What I mean: cannot that hook be registered to "BAT1" too? Because if
yes then we should prevent it. Otherwise this hook which is for "Dell
Primary Battery" could be registered also for secondary battery "BAT1".
(I hope that now it is more clear what I mean).

I think that "Dell Primary Battery Extension" is OK. All SMBIOS code is
currently primary-battery only.

The only my point is to prevent this &dell_battery_hook to be registered
for non-primary battery.
