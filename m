But that is not what happens in the current (v2) code:

1. The apmf_event_handler() is always registered as long as the driver is bound
   (which it must be to catch AMT being re-enabled)

2. apmf_event_handler() does:

+		if (req.pending_req & BIT(APMF_CQL_NOTIFICATION)) {
+			pr_debug("PMF: CQL is supported and notifications %s\n",
+				 req.cql_event ? "Enabled" : "Disabled");
+			pmf_dev->is_cql_event = !!req.cql_event;
+
+			/* update the target mode information */
+			amd_pmf_update_2_cql(pmf_dev);
+		}

3. amd_pmf_update_2_cql() does:

+void amd_pmf_update_2_cql(struct amd_pmf_dev *dev)
+{
+	config_store.transition[AUTO_TRANSITION_TO_PERFORMANCE].target_mode =
+			dev->is_cql_event ? AUTO_PERFORMANCE_ON_LAP : AUTO_PERFORMANCE;
+	if ((config_store.current_mode == AUTO_PERFORMANCE ||
+	     config_store.current_mode == AUTO_PERFORMANCE_ON_LAP) &&
+	    config_store.current_mode !=
+	    config_store.transition[AUTO_TRANSITION_TO_PERFORMANCE].target_mode) {
+		config_store.current_mode =
+				config_store.transition[AUTO_TRANSITION_TO_PERFORMANCE].target_mode;
+		amd_pmf_handle_automode(dev, SLIDER_OP_SET, config_store.current_mode, NULL);
+	}
+	dev_dbg(dev->dev, "updated CQL thermals\n");
+}

Note this does not check dev->is_amt_event at all so CQL events
may lead to amd_pmf_handle_automode() getting called, which sets
the limits even when AMT is disabled.

Right this much I understand.

> Update of CQL happens only when AMT is active.

So you mean the SBIOS is expected to only send CQL events when it has
set AMT to be enabled ?  AFAIK the CQL events are basically on-lap /
not-on-lap events, these can easily also happen when not in AMT mode,
so the SBIOS would need to explicitly not send these events when
lap-mode changes when AMT is disabled.

Since firmware bugs do happen and can sometimes be hard to fix /
have long times to get published IMHO it would be best if 
amd_pmf_update_2_cql() would check dev->is_amt_event and return
early from the function if that is not set.

Regards,

Hans
