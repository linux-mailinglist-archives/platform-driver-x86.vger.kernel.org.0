Okay, thanks for explaining.

I see.

I think Mauro proposed something different, basically exposing RO parts
of the driver only.

The intel-spi driver is being moved from MTD to SPI because the MTD
SPI-NOR maintainers (not me) said that it needs to be done before we can
add any new feature to the driver. That includes also Mauro's patch.

I have v4 of the conversion patch series done already but since it is a
middle of the merge window I'm holding it until v5.16-rc1 is released
(next sunday). I can CC you too and I suppose Hans and Mauro (who else,
let me know). Once the MTD maintainers are happy we can progress adding
features what fwupd needs there too (and the features we, Intel, want to
add there).
