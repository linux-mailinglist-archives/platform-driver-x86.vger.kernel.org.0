Hi Derek,
I am not aware if your software is affected or not by this series as I
have not received reports about it.

If it is, please add:
"ASUSTeK Computer Inc. N-KEY Device"

As a name match to your software (should only take 5 minutes).

I worked with Luke and Dennis on it for the better part of a year so
hopefully they forwarded to you if it affects you or not.

Your software relies on OOT drivers for most devices incl. the Ally so
I am unsure if it is affected in reality. E.g., it would not be
affected in SteamOS and CachyOS. In the future, it would be good to
avoid name matches for your software as it makes it very fragile,
which is a discussion we have had before. I do not think device evdev
names constitute an ABI technically.

Best,
Antheas
