Interesting, so in xev under Wayland you see something like this
on release:

    state 0x0, keycode 38 (keysym 0x61, a), same_screen YES,

With there actually being a keysym of "Zenkaku_Hankaku" there ?

Because that is not working on Wayland on my laptop with the same
issue (after disabling the hwdb mapping) and I don't understand
how that could work at all given that /usr/share/X11/xkb/keycodes/evdev
has no mapping for EV keycode 85 (93 in that file) ?

Yes that is an issue, but see below.

The problem is that filtering keys with modifiers like you are doing
here just does not work.

Your filter is seriously messing with the timing of the keypresses
which can be a real issue when not actually using the toggle touchpad
hotkey.

Lets say the user is playing a game and has mapped super to
one of the fire buttons and is using an in game weapon with
some sort of auto-repeat firing.

And your seqpos variable likely is 0 when super gets pressed,
now the keyboard sends 0xe0, 0x5b which your filter filters
out, and the user keeps super pressed because they expect
the weapon to start firing on auto-repeat. But the super
press is never send until super is released or another key
is pressed so things don't work.

Likewise if the DE, an app or accessibility settings want to
differentiate between a short and a long super press all
presses now become super (pun not intended) short because
you insert the press directly in front of the release, losing
any timing information about how long the key was pressed.

This is why using an i8042 filter for filtering key-combinations
(and the EC emulates a key-combination here) can never work reliably.

OTOH desktop environments already allow having Ctrl+Super+something
keybindings for DE actions. So we can re-use the tried and trusted
modifier handling in the DE to deal with combi part leaving just
the issue of mapping PS/2 scancode 0x76 aka evdev code
85 / KEY_ZENKAKUHANKAKU to something usable by the DE.

ATM both GNOME and KDE already have support for
Ctrl+Super+something for touchpad-toggle except that KDE expects
a "Zenkaku_Hankaku" keysym where as GNOME expects "XF86TouchpadToggle"
arguably the GNOME solution is slightly better because Japanese
keyboard layouts already use/send the "Zenkaku_Hankaku" keysym
unrelated to touchpad-toggle use. And I don't know what happens
when pressing ctrl+super+Zenkaku_Hankaku while using a Japanese
layout.

I think maybe we just need to patch atkbd.c at the kernel to
map scancode 0x76 -> KEY_TOUCHPAD_TOGGLE since normal PS/2
keyboards never generate 0x76, this would lose the mapping to
KEY_ZENKAKUHANKAKU but since /usr/share/X11/xkb/keycodes/evdev
does not even map KEY_ZENKAKUHANKAKU I don't think loosing that
mapping will do a big deal.

So I think that going with the evdev mapping + teaching KDE
that Ctrl+Super+XF86TouchpadToggle is just XF86TouchpadToggle
is the best way forward to solve this once and for all.

Please give using hwdb for this a try.
