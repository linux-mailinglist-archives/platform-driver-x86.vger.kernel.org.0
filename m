I was mulling this over and I think the 1 to 100 slider seems awkward - 
too many levels and the fine graduation mapping onto somewhat coarse (3, 
4 or 5) options doesn't seem to fit well for me. I'm struggling to see 
how it fits the tweaking CPU vs GPU vs system - do we end up introducing 
multiple sliders - which gets complicated with all the choices? I'm just 
not convinced yet.

I'm also not sure about being able to tweak everything too - Linux users 
are smart but is it just getting irritating at that point? Power (hah!) 
users have plenty of tweaking tools at their disposal if they want to 
get into change p-states and tweak every little power option; but this 
exercise is aimed at those who want to make simple general changes - 
increase the power because they have a build to complete, drop into 
quiet mode when watching a movie, or a low power setting when they know 
they're not going to be able to charge for a long time. I suspect some 
smart person will end up automating all this but that's by the by.

So as a counter proposal: Have the slider choose between some key modes 
that we think cover the use cases that people would *want*.

I'd keep the mode list small to avoid it being confusing - more could be 
added later if really needed but I'm guessing (and happy to be 
corrected) that the majority of activities would fit into just a few 
boxes reasonably well.

For instance (I think I get the following from the above):
  - low power/Cool
  - Quiet
  - balance/default
  - CPU performance
  - GPU performance

The vendors would just choose their optimal firmware setting for that 
use case depending on what they have available.

Apart from the GPU performance option that maps pretty well for Lenovo 
and I think it maps very nicely for HP. I wanted to squish low power ad 
quiet together but that seemed unfair - they are very similar though :)
I'm struggling to think of other use cases that would really 
matter...thoughts? Is this *too* simple?
