See my new proposal in reaction to Benjamin's email.

UGh, do we really need to export this though. We have the lap_mode thing
already; and that is something which we will need for other reasons in
the future too. Any UI for selecting performance modes can display a
warning when lap_mode is true saying that: "The laptop has detected that it
is sitting on someone's lap and that performance may be limited
because of this." (feel free to improve the text).

I guess we could split the "value" attribute from my reply to Benjamin's
email into "configured_value" (rw) and "actual_value" (rw) attributes.
If we have the info we might as well export it I guess,.

Regards,

Hans
