OK, I see from your patch that it uses the direct mapped read-only
region to read this data.

Do we know what information exactly fwupd needs? I mean exposing all of
this might not be good idea from security perspective (but I'm not an
expert). However, we can perhaps expose some of it through intel-spi,
and make that work so that distros can enable it safely. My concern of
removing the DANGEROUS tag is that we end up bricking yet another Lenovo
laptop by accident. Avoiding that would give me more peace of mind :)
