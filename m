Armin, first of all let me say tht I really appreciate your input / help with
reviewing pdx86 patches.

The problem is that your suggestion with 2 drivers attaching themselves
to 2 different wmi_device-s is that we will need to introduce some
shared global data / variable for the 2 to communicate. Notifiers
don't magically work. They need a shared notifier head between the
producer and consumer(s) to work. So you are still introducing
a singleton.

Sometimes this is a good solution, but in this case this really
seems like an overly complicated solution to me. Making the code
needlessly complicated to deal with a theoretical scenario which
I don't believe will ever happen.

Also see below.

Ah I see (wrt the above discussion), your aiming for some ideal scenario here
were all WMI code gets converted to the new model and the singleton assuming
functions can simply be removed.

I'm afraid that this will never happen. The old way of doing things is deprecated
but if you look at drivers like e.g. acer-wmi not only does it deal with
7 different WMI GUIDs in a single driver. It also exposes sysfs interface under
a platform_device which its registers. Moving drivers like this over to
binding to a wmi_device instead of to a self-created platform-device, will
break userspace API so this simply cannot be done.

For reasons of these I have let go the idea of the ideal scenario being
converting all existing WMI code to the new model. I don't believe that
this is a realistic plan.

As such although I don't want to see new WMI drivers which completely
use the old model. I'm ok with using some of the old model when
single driver needs to deal with more then 1 GUID and the expectations
are that the involved GUIDs will always be and stay singletons.

Andrew, sorry for the conflicting advice you are getting here.
Unfortunately this sometimes happens.

In the end I think both approaches (2 separate driver for the
GUIDs; or just keep using wmi_evaluate_method()) are fine.

So since you are doing the work here, you get to choice which
solution you want to pick for the next version.

Regards,

Hans
