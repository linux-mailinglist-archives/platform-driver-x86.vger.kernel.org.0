This isn't the whole story.

The original naming was board specific. Then Enrico (not unreasonably - I actually prefer his
naming) changed the naming to be non board specific. Then within 2 months PC Engines introduced ACPI
based config using the old names.

So if we are holding "userspace breakage" as the gold standard, then the original (also the current)
names have actually been around longest and likely cause the least userspace breakage.

Also, some other pieces of this module have already been removed (SIM Swap), so there is an existing
precedent for "userspace breakage" and trimming down this platform driver.


In big picture terms, changing the name of the LED device doesn't seem a huge concern to me... A
udev rule can setup compatibility forwards/backwards quite trivially I think?

Kind regards
