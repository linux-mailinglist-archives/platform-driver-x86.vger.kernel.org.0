I don't doubt there are plenty of systems without it, but you're=20
supposed to document ELC, not non-ELC systems under this section.

If the system does not have ELC, this section has zero relevance for
the admin. (And it's a job for marketting people, not for Linux=20
documentation, to convince people they need this new and shiny
thing. :-))

Thus, the base assumption in this section is that ELC is supported and=20
usable.

I think you make an issue out of a non-issue if you think it's problem to=
=20
state feature A improves performance if there are also features B and C=20
that improve it.

"special"? I didn't get that impression at all. I'm far from convinced ELC=
=20
is "special" or needs to be presented as such.

So do I read you right, this is nothing ELC-specific? So all ELC does is=20
adds those tunables (limits/overrides)?

I was specifically talking about what "ELC" is but you downgraded wording=
=20
back to "hardware" in your reply. So I have to repeat myself, what ELC=20
consists of? Are these non-OS dependent features (that "hardware always=20
does") part of ELC or not (for the avoidance of potential=20
misunderstandings, this is assuming no ELC tunables added by this series=20
are touched by the admin)?

Obviously, when one of the tunables is touched, it impacts the allowed
operating region of the autonomous algorithm (ELC tunables acting as=20
what look like "overrides").
