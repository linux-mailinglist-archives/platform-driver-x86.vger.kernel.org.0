Actually you may be quite right because number of bugs is growing. The
numbering scheme of GPIOs is mystery and subject to last minute changes
(because it's pure artificial layer on top of the hardware). It's quite
possible that the driver was upstreamed with outdated mapping (see 4th
parameter to the groups in the communities in the driver). I'm investigating
this.
