Fair. Technically, 0 is a valid register value but in this case it
would work the same, as it would be silently skipped. Ideally, it
would be u16 with -1 but at that point it is a combined boolean +
register which is the same as a boolean with a fixed register value
but more complicated.

Yeah that is true, but when it comes to this small subset of handhelds
the kernel is considered broken if it has a failure rate on sleep so I
would not optimize for that.

This is what other bugs is referring to.

For these devices the fan speed would remain static, which is a
failure mode. For other devices such as the Xbox Ally, it has a
hardware fan curve with baked minimums so it is ok.

The good thing with the lsp0 device is that if it is in ACPI it always
works (except on the Xbox Ally which is a different thread). So it
either never works or it always does and there is no chance a user
will inadvertently have it fail and not notice it.

If the LSP0 device is not in ACPI, this means the BIOS is set with
modern standby disabled, which is an issue in certain models of this
manufacturer. But in this case, the FADT does not have the "S0ix more
efficient than S3" bit toggled, which can be detected. So e.g., on
Bazzite if this is the case the device is forced to hibernate or the
sleep button does not work. In other distributions, sleep will never
work, so users will notice and again it's not inadvertent.

Now, if users decide to use smokeless on a distribution other than
Bazzite to enable CBS and toggle on modern standby there is a
different failure mode. And that is that when the battery runs out and
the CMOS memory resets, modern standby will be disabled, so the device
will fail to sleep the next time and they might not notice it. I do
not recommend my users do BIOS mods, but specifically for those that
chose to do it and are not my users (see: forced hibernation), this
can potentially happen
