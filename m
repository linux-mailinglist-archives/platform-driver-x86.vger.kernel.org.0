Ah ok, so in KDE the shortcut somehow works under Wayland despite
the lack of xkb keysym mapping (maybe match on keycode?) and then 
the compositor absorbs / eats the Zenkaku_Hankaku key-press +
release as it does with other compositor handled hotkeys leaving
apps like xev to just see the modifier press/release events
(which the compositor cannot delay / filter for the same reasons
as why an i8042 kbd filter won't work).

Yeah these single key which the EC makes send a whole key sequence
EC level key-bindings are a pain to deal with. Some for some other
keys emulating Windows hotkey presses like "Super + P", but those
are simply send unmodified to the DE to let the DE deal with them.

Sending these unmodified to the DE pretty much is the only thing
we can do.

Yes I don't think the 0x76 ps/2 scancode is used on any actual
keyboards other then for this toggle touchpad key thing.
