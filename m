If technically feasible, gathering all the data in a single place would
be my preference. Whether that should take the form of software nodes in
all cases, or be modelled as custom data that the int3472 driver would
interpret to create the regulators and clocks is a different (but
related) question.

The very important part is to ensure that the correct board data will be
used, as otherwise we could damage the hardware.
