Subject: [PATCH v5 0/4] Fix SW_TABLET_MODE detection method

The intension for this patch was to address SW_TABLET_MODE detection 
problem.  It is during the initial investigation; two other issues were 
identified and are related to the initial task.  

First, several WMI queries were reporting error 0x05 including 
HPWMI_HARDWARE_QUERY that is responsible for returning dock and table 
modes values. See patch v5 part 2 and 3 comments for list of WMI queries 
affected.  The driver now reports the appropriate states and values 
correctly.

Lastly, a limiting data size restriction was discovered. 
struct bios_args data member size limits all possible WMI commands 
to those requiring buffer size of 128 bytes or less.  Several WMI 
commands and queries require a buffer size larger than 128 bytes 
hence limiting current and new feature supported by the driver. 
hp_wmi_perform_query function changed to handle the memory 
allocation and release of any required buffer size. 


Description of changes between version 4 and version 5
------------------------------------------------------

v5 patch 1: Fix hp_wmi_read_int() reporting error (0x05)
	-Moved hp_wmi_read_int() to a separate patch.
	-Initially part of v4 patch 1
	
v5 patch 2: Fix SW_TABLET_MODE detection method
	-Remaining part are changes included in v4 patch 1
	-Replaced return values with -ENODEV errors
	-Updated how the closing return value is calculated.
	-Patch 2 is dependent of patch 1 in order for tablet 
	 mode detection to work properly
	

v5 patch 3: Fix 0x05 error code reported by several WMI calls
	-No new changes were introduced.
	-Patch is identical to v4 patch 2
	
v5 patch 4: Changing bios_args.data to be dynamically allocated
	-Replace sizeof() with struct_size() and flex_array_size() helpers
	-Added ret variable value when the output buffer is zero
