I will try to move some of that documentation there, this is a great idea.

Yes, you are right. To become a knob this would require a much bigger
discussion. I would also like to move Sleep calls as part of that. The
Legion Go and OneXPlayer devices turn off their controllers as part of
that and other modern standby devices limit their power envelope
(perhaps the Legion Go too). I think the Sleep call is where most of
the userspace usability will come from. Display On/Off is a bit of a
NOOP on most devices.

As for the LSB0 enter and exit, I do not know where the correct place
for those would be, and perhaps someone from Microsoft needs to be
consulted on that. The documentation is very vague. However it is
clear to me that they should be close to where they are right now, so
they very likely do not need to move.

There is also the new _DSM intent to turn display on 9 call. Which
meshes with the sleep call. That call is made before Sleep Exit, if
the kernel knows that the wake-up will cause the display to turn on,
to boost the thermal envelope of the device and help it wake up
quicker. If the Sleep call is moved then we would also have to
introduce that somewhere to avoid wake-up time regressions on devices
that support it, which also raises the question of how would the
kernel decide if an interrupt will cause the display to turn on before
unfreezing userspace (bulk of resume) (or should it be done after
unfreezing?).

From what I know Luke plans to remove that quirk ASAP due to new
firmware. I would keep it around until this patch series merges
personally and remove it as part of that. As it will probably cause
regressions if both are in place and require manual intervention if
either is not. I will also note that the quirk in asus-wmi calls the
Display On/Off calls a second time and during the suspend sequence,
which is not in any way proper. So if future devices need this kind of
quirk, it really does not seem like a good idea to me to paper over
their problems by calling the notifications a second time in random
platform drivers. There is the question of where that quirk should be
placed, that is true, but I IMO it should be a pm problem.

Perhaps not in the location where I put it though and perhaps it
should be done with LSB0 callbacks instead. Although, being done this
way allows for it to blend with the suspend sequence. Ideally, the
Display Off delay would be blended with userspace going down such that
if e.g., there is heavy userspace activity that requires ~2s to
freeze, the quirk would add no delay. Instead, it would only add delay
if userspace freezes quickly (less than .5s). Same can be said with
Sleep Entry and beginning prepare_late, which blocks the EC interrupts
(that would need a lot of investigation though).

On that note, it seems to me that the Ally has 2 bugs related to the
_DSM calls 3 and 4. First bug is that Display On is gated on current
firmware and only works when the USB subsystem is powered on.
Allegedly, this is fixed on the upcoming firmware but it is not
something I have verified personally. I will verify it in 10 days or
so, if the new firmware does not fail QA I guess.

However, there is a second bug with Display Off in _DSM 4. The
controller of the Ally needs time to power off, around 500ms.
Otherwise it gets its power clipped and/or does not power off
correctly. This causes the issues mentioned in the discussion and I
have no indication that this is fixed with newer controller firmware.
It is also my understanding that most of the testing of the new
firmware happened with the asus-wmi quirk in place, which papers over
that issue, so removing the quirk might be premature in any case.

We have currently released this patch series in Bazzite and I am happy
to report that it completely fixes all controller related issues in
the Ally devices and makes them behave exactly as they do in Windows,
regardless of firmware and bug for bug.

So we will be keeping it around and extending it as appropriate to
include the Sleep calls. I am reminded multiple times per week that
the Ally has TDP suspend bugs, where if the user is playing a heavy
game, the EC of the device tends to get stuck at 6W and fail to
respond after waking the device. So moving calls 7, 8 is the natural
next step in this investigation. I already have a draft patch on
standby, that we plan to AB test soon.

I did run it through before sending the patch. However, some of the
warnings were a bit cryptic to me... I will run it again.

I will add a note for asus-wmi on future patch series.

First 3 patches of the series are designed to NOOP before patch 4. Did
you mean patch 3 (which adds the delay) instead of 4?
