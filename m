Feel free to not apply it. I think I don't need to resend w/o it (IIRC the rest
pretty much independent of this change). But if you need a v2, tell me.

I consider one more, i.e. if we know that value may not be negative the
unsigned type gives a hint. I always stumbled over signed integers used for
loop counters since they confuse me (Q in mind: "should I read code carefully
and check if it may or may not be signed? Why it's signed?").

That's why I like the idea of be a bit stricter about types.

Hope this explains my motivation.

Usually I expect that RFC has less priority than normal series and I wouldn't
expect any maintainer (with some rare exceptions) to take series marked as RFC.
And TBH I was wondering why you marked them as such, to me that was fine to
send as normal one.

Thanks for the review!
