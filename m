Dear,

I am Mrs. Alice Jahab and I am married to Mr. Razaki Jahab for 19
years without a child and my husband died in four days from his
illness. I am contacting you to let you know my desire to give the
amount of US $ 3.5 million to charities in your country that I
inherited from my late husband. Due to my disease (cancer) that have
been confirmed for only eight months by doctors, so it is my wish that
this money is invested and distributed to charities of your choice
such as home orphanages, schools, the homeless people, nursing home,
hospitals and many other things that will be for the benefit of the
least privileged. I want to send the following information so I start
to process the judgment going to show that the new beneficiary to the
fund.

(1) Your full name ...
(2) Address ...
(3) The city and the country ...
(4 Age / Sex ......
(5) Occupation .......

(jahaalice216@gmail.com) is my private email

As soon as we receive your response confirming acceptance of the work,
I will give all pertinent information and sworn testimony authorizing
the bank to disclose and transfer the money to you as my duly
appointed representative.

Thanks,
Mrs. Alice Jahab
