I'd have said 72 characters but since you now pointed out checkpatch seems 
to have only a slightly higher limit we can go along with that 75 
characters. I think that 72 char limit is derived from 80-2*4 (4 char wide 
margins on both sides on 80 char wide terminal). Be aware though some 
other maintainers do require 72 chars.

And obviously for URLs (or other stuff) that should be kept on a single 
line, you have the license to break that limit even if checkpatch would 
complain but I guess you knew that :-).
