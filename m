I see what you mean, sorry, please ignore what I said, it has no
relevance here. I'll change the order here and take a look at the
other commits with this in mind.

In other commits there were instances where I could've made
similar changes, but I chose not to, because I wanted to keep
the "stylistic" and functional changes separate.
For example, in patch 9:

@@ -353,9 +353,11 @@ static ssize_t show_ideapad_cam(struct device *dev,
 {
 =09unsigned long result;
 =09struct ideapad_private *priv =3D dev_get_drvdata(dev);
+=09int err;

I did not change the order. Is that OK or do you think it'd be
preferable to change the order here as well?


Thanks,
