The thinkpad_acpi driver carries a lot of legacy with it.
So in general we are careful with making changes because some people
still use quite old ThinkPad-s and it is tricky to make sure we
don't break stuff on older models. So yeah there is some cruft in
a bunch of places in this driver.

In this case it seems that cleaning things up is a straight forward fix
though, so we really should do so.

I agree, moving to a "fixed" attribute_group, with an is_visible
check for the optional attributes would be a much better fix and
allow removal of a whole bunch of custom code.

If anyone following this thread could submit a patch doing that,
then that would be great.

I'm not sure if all attributes are documented, but a lot of them
(including all recently added ones) are documented in:
Documentation/admin-guide/laptops/thinkpad-acpi.rst
