Why not fix the spi drivers to do this properly?  What is preventing you
from doing that instead of adding a new user/kernel api that you will
have to support for the next 20+ years?

The problem here is that you are abusing the platform driver code and
making a "fake" device that is not attached to anything real, and
without a driver.  That should not be done, as you do not know what
hardware this driver is going to be run on.

Bind to the real hardware resource please.

Again, without some sort of "we only bind to the hardware on these types
of devices", a driver like this is not going to be allowed, because you
are not checking the hardware at all!

Also, drivers are loaded based on the hardware being found on the system
and having the driver loaded automatically.  That isn't happening here
at all, so that's another reason why this isn't going to be acceptable.

You HAVE to have hardware detection, otherwise the code is broken,
sorry.
