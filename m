Right, that is why I suggested making it a RFC patch and I would
certainly not apply that patch without it being tested by Dell first.

The idea behind the patch is for it to be a way to get a discussion
about this started. In my experience patches tend to get more of
a reaction then hypothetical discussions about changes :)

If you don't feel comfortable doing this, that is fine, lets wait what
the Dell folks have to say; and if they don't respond I might do a RFC
myself.

Thanks.
