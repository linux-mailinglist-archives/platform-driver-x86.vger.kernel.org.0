My motivation for these messages was to provide information to user that
kernel received event, but was not able to process it as it do not
understand it.

It could help in situation when user press special key and nothing is
delivered to userspace. But he could see that something happened in log.

Similar message is also printed by PS/2 keyboard driver atkbd.c:

	case ATKBD_KEY_UNKNOWN:
		dev_warn(&serio->dev,
			 "Unknown key %s (%s set %d, code %#x on %s).\n",
			 atkbd->release ? "released" : "pressed",
			 atkbd->translated ? "translated" : "raw",
			 atkbd->set, code, serio->phys);
		dev_warn(&serio->dev,
			 "Use 'setkeycodes %s%02x <keycode>' to make it known.\n",
			 code & 0x80 ? "e0" : "", code & 0x7f);
		input_sync(dev);
		break;
