This bug needs to be fixed because

1) It doesn't affect Windows
2) Average people will never know how to deal with issue
3) I cannot ask my motherboard vendor (ASUS) to fix this issue in BIOS beca=
use
they don't provide support for Linux - they barely provide any support at a=
ll.

OoB experience of Linux users should not be "I don't get any sensors output,
how to fix that?" Most users don't even know what and how to Google. They d=
on't
know about dmesg either.

That's an effing horrible attitude.

I'm CC'ing Linus because I absolutely hate what's going on.
