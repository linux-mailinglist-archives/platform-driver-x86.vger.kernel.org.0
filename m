Quite a few probably. But as discussed here I plan to write a generic
sensor_power helper library since many sensor drivers have a lot of
boilerplate code to get clks + regulators + enable/reset gpios. The plan
is to add support for a "privacy-led" to this library so that all sensors
which use this get support for free.

Laurent pointed out that some sensors may have more complex power-up
sequence demands, which is true. But looking at existing drivers
then many follow a std simple pattern which can be supported in
a helper-library.

A LED cladd device will allow userspace to override the privacy-led
value which is considered bad from a privacy point of view. This
was actually already discussed here:

https://lore.kernel.org/platform-driver-x86/e5d8913c-13ba-3b11-94bc-5d1ee1d736b0@ideasonboard.com/

See the part of the thread on the cover-letter with Dan, Laurent
and me participating.

And a LED class device also will be a challenge to bind to the right
sensor on devices with more then one sensor, where as mentioned
above using GPIO-mappings give us the binding to the right sensor
for free.

Regards,

Hans
