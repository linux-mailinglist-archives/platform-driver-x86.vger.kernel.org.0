Dropped other participants by accident.  Please see my comments below.

The original code created an insize buffer size of 128 bytes
regardless if the WMI call required a smaller buffer or not.  This
particular behavior occurs in older BIOS and reproduced in OMEN
laptops.  Newer BIOS handles  buffer sizes properly and meets the
latest specification requirements.  This is the reason why testing
with a dynamically allocated buffer did not uncover any failures with
the test systems at hand.
One additional point was considered.  The purpose for introducing
dynamically allocated buffers was primarily to support WMI calls that
required buffers size bigger than 128 bytes.  The decision  was made
to separate those WMI calls to a separate driver and implement the new
firmware-attribute framework.

The current review request title is  "[PATCH] Revert "platform/x86:
hp-wmi: Changing bios_args.data to be dynamically allocated"

I am testing a cleaner solution to submit instead of  reverting the
changes to hp_wmi_perform_query method.  The changes were made and
tested on business notebooks without any issues.  I will submit a new
patch as soon as I get the test results from a  community member who
owns an Omen 15 system.

The proposed patch which I am pending test results, it is as follows

diff --git a/drivers/platform/x86/hp-wmi.c b/drivers/platform/x86/hp-wmi.c

-----

This code eliminates the 0x05 error codes across the other WMI calls.
Unfortunately, I do not have an Omen system to complete the tests.

zero_insize_support() seems ok for Omen platforms but don't know if it
may cause errors on newer notebooks.  I will run the patch locally and
will update the results.
Bedant if it possible, can you apply the changes described earlier and
let me know if it fixes Omen notebook issues?


Regards,

Jorge.
