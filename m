--- Comment #63 from Sydney Meyer (syd.meyer@gmail.com) ---
Hello all,

perhaps this is the wrong place to ask such a question, but after reading m=
any
sites on the interwebs about the issue, i am left with the impression that =
most
people (me included) do not actually understand the implications introduced=
 by
turning on/off knobs like "acpi_enforce_resources=3Dlax". Also, i read a lo=
t,
mostly unclear, comments about "hardware damage" and therefore would like to
ask, what is actually the recommended way to go about this with the situati=
on
as it is now? Is this issue perhaps only relevant for manual fan control,
because with or without "acpi_enforce_resources=3Dlax" and the nct6775 kern=
el
module loaded, the system appears to adjust the fan speed for the appropria=
te
load either way and there aren't any noticable differences between CPU temps
either. So i guess my question basically boils down to this: Is there actua=
lly
something to worry about, apart from not beeing able to see/control fan spe=
eds?
I just have become a little worried now with all the contradictive informat=
ion
out there, also read (on phoronix) about this [1] and this [2] a few weeks =
ago.
This is a Asus X570 Gaming-E Board with a Ryzen 5950X CPU. As a regular use=
r,
am i going to fry my little computer by running Linux on it?

I understand that nobody will guarantee anything, of course, i just felt th=
is
might be a good place for a qualified answer, because, obviously, i don't
understand any of this low-level stuff.

Thanks a bunch.
