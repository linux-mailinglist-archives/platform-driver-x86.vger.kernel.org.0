Hello!

If it is really truth that the 100 ms delay is in the kernel then you
can use e.g. perf tool to trace where in the kernel happens that delay.

Kernel driver for keyboard backlight just calls Dell's SMBIOS API which
issues SMM call. After that processor enters into privileged x86 SMM
mode into Dell's SMM hook installed by the Dell firmware during machine
boot and do appropriate keyboard backlight change call. During this
procedure is normal execution of x86 processor stopped and even kernel
does not have control over it.

I already saw that people reported similar issues to Dell's SMM API for
temperature and fan control and measured that processor stays in Dell's
SMM code for a long time. So I can imagine that there could be a similar
issue also with keyboard. But I can be completely wrong.

I'm not sure if that keyboard backlight is related to SMM or not (this
needs to be debugged) but basically kernel cannot do anything with
Dell's SMM code. If problem is really in Dell SMM you can just report
issue to Dell. If problem is somewhere else in kernel we need to know
more details (e.g. in which function kernel spends lot of time) and then
we can look how to optimize it.

I understand that in this case it is harder to debug this issue. I know
only perf tool for doing these analysis but maybe somebody else can help
how it can be debugged in other way?
