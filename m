Yep, this is what I was wondering. I will investigate this. It would
be good to get some comments on the quirk naming as well.

So do I. Essentially here is how the Windows software works: when it
first opens, it saves the current curve in Windows registry. Then,
when the user sets a fan curve, it applies it in the same way we do
here and sets a bit in AP. When the custom curve is removed, it unsets
that bit and restores the original curve in WMI.

The logical reasoning would be that that bit controls the fan curve.
This is how it is named in the software. However, when setting that
bit on its own, it seems to only partially affect the fan curve. E.g.,
when the fan curve is 100% in all points, unsetting that bit makes it
go down to 50% when no load occurs. When using the default fan curve,
it goes to 0%. Therefore, it seems like that bit makes the fan curve
semi-autonomous?

The fan curve seems to be hardware specific and resets after reboots.
So a straightforward way to get it is to grab it on a fresh boot.
