Yes.

Interesting, maybe the primary interface should even be an integer in
that range, so for each system_performance_profile class-device we
would then have the following attributes:

mappings (ro) - This attribute gives a list of valid performance-profile-values
              In the form of "<integer-value> <description-string>\n", e.g.:

              25 Low Power
              50 Balanced
              100 Performance

value (rw) - Integer in the range 0 (lowest performance setting) - 100
              (highest performance setting). Note most drivers will only
              support a number of specific discrete values, see the mappings
              attribute. Userspace may write an arbitrary value between 0
              and 100, this will be rounded to the closest supported discrete
              value.

value_string (ro) - String representation of the currently active value,
              this is a shortcut for looking up the string in the mappings
              attribute yourself.

lap_mode (ro) - <lap_mode text here>

Something like p-p-daemon would then just interact with the value and lap_mode
fields, ignoring the mappings. It would then also need to do some rounding of
its own when reading value to map things back to its own internal levels.
One issue for p-p-d here might be that it writes its internal integer value
corresponding to say "Low power", then reads back a value and when rounding
that to its own discrete steps ends up at a different level then "Low power".
This can be avoid by using the mappings file to get the supported discrete values
and then only generate mappings for the discrete values to its own internal
discrete steps once and always use those mappings, thus always writing a
supported discrete value, avoiding rounding issues.

I think that this will give us a nice and flexible interface. Note if
anyone disagrees, or has a better idea please speak up. Once we have
decided on what the interface is going to be, we are effectively stuck
with it.

Regards,

Hans
