Right, this is the right thing to do on machines such as the Latitude E5570.

My question is more, what if, in the future some machine does not have say
string bios-attributes, but it does have enum and int attributes ?

The current code will then still refuse to bind / load, which seems wrong.

Note that on the E5570 there are no enum and no string and no int attributes,
so we could also delay the return -ENODEV until after we have enumerated all 3
types and if all 3 have a wmi_priv.foo_instances_count of 0 then return -ENODEV
that seems like the logical thing to do here to me.

Regards,

Hans
