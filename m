Hi,

Currently both intel_scu_ipc.c and intel_pmc_ipc.c implement the same SCU
IPC communications with minor differences. This duplication does not make
much sense so this series reworks the two drivers so that there is only a
single implementation of the SCU IPC. In addition to that the API will be
updated to take SCU instance pointer as an argument, and most of the
callers will be converted to this new API. The old API is left there but
the plan is to get rid the callers and then the old API as well (this is
something we are working with Andy Shevchenko).

The intel_pmc_ipc.c is then moved under MFD which suits better for this
kind of a driver that pretty much sets up the SCU IPC and then creates a
bunch of platform devices for the things sitting behind the PMC. The driver
is renamed to intel_pmc_bxt.c which should follow the existing conventions
under drivers/mfd (and it is only meant for Intel Broxton derivatives).

Previous version of the series:

  v3: https://www.spinics.net/lists/platform-driver-x86/msg20583.html
  v2: https://www.spinics.net/lists/platform-driver-x86/msg20446.html
  v1: https://www.spinics.net/lists/platform-driver-x86/msg20359.html

Changes from v3:

  * Rename intel_scu_ipc_probe() to intel_scu_ipc_register() and _remove()
    to _unregister() accordingly.
  * Make intel_scu_ipc_register() to perform handle resource request and
    ioremap itself.
  * Add devm_intel_scu_ipc_register().
  * Improve kernel-docs of struct intel_soc_pmic.
  * Add Documentation/ABI/obsolete/sysfs-driver-intel_pmc_bxt to document the
    two sysfs attributes the driver exposes.
  * Fix typos in the MFD driver
  * Drop gcr_data_readq() wrapper
  * No need to check for !pmcdev.gcr_mem_base in the MFD accessors
  * Allocate PMC instance dynamically and pass this from the callers
    (telemetry) as well
  * Take the lock in intel_pmc_s0ix_counter_read() to be consistent with other
    register accessors (and serialize them).
  * Use kstrtoul() return value directly (new patch)
  * Use static const MFD cell and resources where possible. Take a copy of
    these before they get populated and passed to the MFD code.
  * Use module_platform_driver() in the MFD driver
  * Drop dev_dbg() prints.
  * Return -EINVAL instead of -ENXIO when platform_get_resource() for
    mandatory resources.
  * Clarify "residency" in intel_pmc_s0ix_counter_read().

Did not convert to use regmap because register access is 64-bit and it
looks like regmap read/write API does not support this.

I also dropped Andy's reviewed-by tag from the MFD patch (37/38) because it
changed quite much from the previous version.

Changes from v2:

  * Added review tags from Andy
  * Patch 12: Put intel_scu_ipc_probe() prototype and implementation in one line
  * Patch 12: Correct wording in Kconfig description.
  * Patch 12: Put devm_request_irq() in one line.
  * Patch 14: Add blank line before intel_scu_ipc_dev_update() in header.
  * Patch 14: intel_scu_ipc_dev_update() move 'u8 data' to the next line in header.
  * Patch 14: Drop outlen check in intel_scu_ipc_dev_command_with_size().
  * Patch 16: Added Guenter's ack.
  * Patch 25: Put intel_scu_ipc_dev_command() call in one line.
  * Patch 25: Put intel_scu_ipc_dev_simple_command() call in one line.
  * Patch 32: Drop X86_INTEL_MID dependency from INTEL_SCU_PCI.
  * Patch 34: Split MFD_INTEL_PMC_BXT dependencies one per line.
  * Patch 35: Reorder to happen before patch 34.
  * Patch 35: Drop comma from terminating line.

Changes from v1:

  * Update changelog of patch 16 according to what the patch actually does.
  * Add kernel-doc for struct intel_soc_pmic.
  * Move octal permission patch to be before MFD conversion.
  * Convert the intel_pmc_bxt.c to MFD APIs whilst it is being moved under
    drivers/mfd.

I would prefer this to be merged through platform/x86 or MFD trees assuming
there are no objections.

I have tested this on Intel Edison (Merrifield) and Joule (Broxton-M).
