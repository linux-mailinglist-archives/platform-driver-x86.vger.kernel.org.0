Got it. Sometimes I forget switch/case exists. I'll adjust the v8 patch=20
I sent out earlier.

We can add the fact that a variation exists with a more typical setup=20
also. The G713Q has no throttle_thermal and in the dsdt dump looks like=20
it possible can read back the curve that is set by the user. This works=20
in our favour though.

There is. I develop asusctl in conjunction with these patches. I'd=20
certainly like to find the best way to fit all of this together.

I agree.

It looks like I need to adjust how pwm[n]_enable works anyway:

`pwm[1-*]_enable`
Fan speed control method:
- 0: no fan speed control (i.e. fan at full speed)
- 1: manual fan speed control enabled (using `pwm[1-*]`)
- 2+: automatic fan speed control enabled

So maybe on "manual" I can make it so the get method does what is in=20
fan_curve_check_present() (and change that part also) and fetches the=20
"defaults" on enable. This might even give us the fan curve that was=20
set (and looks like it will on the machine that has no thermal throttle=20
profile, v8 patch) - I'll try this anyway and see what it looks like.=20
This seems to be the best approach given how the G713Q works anyway.

The issue I have with the above is that it overwrites any curve set.=20
But given that it'll most likely be managed in userspace that's maybe=20
*not* an issue. Otherwise would it be sensible to add something like=20
`pwm1_reset`? I don't see anything like that in the related docs=20
though. `pwm1_reset` would be to re-read the defaults from the acpi=20
method.

Central to the above is that we can still read 0, 1, 2 curves from acpi=20
- I was thinking to use the throttle_thermal mode to choose which one=20
and that would be the only use of it. And won't store them as=20
per-profile, which becomes a moot point when userspace is managing it=20
anyway.

Many thanks,
Luke.
