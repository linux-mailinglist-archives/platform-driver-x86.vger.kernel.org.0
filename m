Looks like you're right to make this platform specific. At least for now it looks like the definitions are tied to the platform.
Strange as we have a common spec on the x86 Thinkpads, but at least for now this is t14s Qualcomm specific.

I did get back some details - not quite as much as I wanted, but enough to confirm that all your definitions look correct.
Main point of interest is they didn't send me the BL2 details - so not sure if that is needed?

I still have some more digging to do here I'm afraid.

Ack. Don't know the details on that yet.
