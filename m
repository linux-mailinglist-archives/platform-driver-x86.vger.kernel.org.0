Hi Mario,

Please fold these paragraphs to 80 characters so that they're easier to 
read as textfiles (the table can obviously exceed that but there should be 
no reason for the text paragraphs to have excessively long lines).

My apologies for taking so long to get to review this series. Most of my 
comments are quite minor but there's also 1-2 things that seem more 
important. It seemed to me that there is some disconnetion between the 
promises made in the Kconfig description and what is provided by the patch 
series.
