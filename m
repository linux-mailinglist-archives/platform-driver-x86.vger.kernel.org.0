The v2 patch does look better to me, thanks.

But IMHO it is not good idea to fix userspace API issues during or
after rc6. So lets keep this marked as broken in Kconfig for 5.19 final
and then we can get something like v2 merged into 5.20-rc1 in a couple
of weeks and then also remove the broken marking.

For enterprise distros to be able to backport this what matters is it
being in Torvald's master branch, so from that pov this just delays
things a couple of weeks. Which is well worth it IMHO to give us some more
time to get the userspace API right.

Regards,

Hans
