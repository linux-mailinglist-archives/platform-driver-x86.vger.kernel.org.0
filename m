amd-pstate vs acpi-cpufreq is actually irrelevant for the issue at hand.  F=
rom
your debug log I believe the issue is that for your machine a component out=
side
of the Linux kernel is supposed to influence power targets.  It's either th=
e EC
or something that runs in the APU's TEE environment.

More on this later in my response.

No it's not in 6.5 right now.  Hans is OOO, but I expect will be queued for=
 a
future 6.5-rc when he returns.

In Linux the static power slider (SPS) is exported from amd-pmf as an ACPI
platform profile.  Power-profiles daemon uses this to let you pick "Power
saver", "balanced" or "performance" modes.

Until that patch SPS is only exported if targets are adjustable directly via
PMF driver.  But your system advertises that power slider changes should no=
tify
the SBIOS because your system doesn't adjust targets via the PMF driver.

I don't have visibility into your EC code, but if it's by EC the patch will=
 fix
it when you pick "power saver" or "performance" in power profiles daemon.

If the EC doesn't do it, it will probably require some code that we'll be
releasing later for some other PMF features.
