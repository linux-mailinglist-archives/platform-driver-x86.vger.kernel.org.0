My guess is that none of it works on new models. The LEGACY wmi device
is not longer included on new machines, as all lighting control is done
through an EC and the WMAX device was repurposed to fan/thermal control.
I say this based on exploring quite a few acpidumps and a couple RGB
control Windows open source alternatives.

Yes! I'd like to do this but unfortunately some user space applications
might depend on attributes being available to a platform device named
"alienware-wmi". This is why I wanted to have a unified "alienware-wmi"
platform driver.

Thank you for your feedback!
