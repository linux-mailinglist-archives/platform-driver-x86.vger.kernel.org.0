Oooops...
I didn't have the trace (at least that I could find) but I figured it would be easy to recreate it.
Went to make the change again...and realised what I had got wrong.
I needed to replace:
        tpacpi_pdev = platform_device_register_simple(TPACPI_DRVR_NAME, PLATFORM_DEVID_NONE,
                                                        NULL, 0);
with 
        tpacpi_pdev = platform_create_bundle(&tpacpi_pdriver, NULL, NULL, 0, NULL, 0);

(previously I had replaced the platform_driver_register...sigh)

With the change done, I think, correctly - no oops and everything is working.

No worries - I'd never come across platform_create_bundle so it's a good learning experience for me. Thanks for all the help.
