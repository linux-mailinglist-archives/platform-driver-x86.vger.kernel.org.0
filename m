Hi, sorry for the delayed reply. Your patch doesn't seem to work, I
still have the issue where the switch is in the wrong state after
suspend/resume.

And yes, it's been a while, and I believe the issues did exist during
that time however it was easy to ignore/forget since I'm on X11 where
libinput doesn't respond to tablet mode switches, so I neglected to
report the issue for a while. Also, about the BIOS, I'm a little
hesistant to update it since I don't have a battery. I have version A11
and the newest is A15, but Dell's update notes only mention security
fixes, so maybe it doesn't matter.
