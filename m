The battery is not disconnected. It still provides backup. Unplugging
the charger does not turn off the device. So it is more murky.

From a userspace perspective it is inhibit-charge 1-1.

Sorry I mispoke. When inhibit-charge-awake, the device only charges
while in s0i0. When inhibit-charge, it never charges. This includes
s0i3, S4, and S5. The devices that support this only support modern
standby.

I just verified this.

Sorry I mispoke. Charging happens under modern standby under -awake.

So -awake would mean awake (s0i0) here.

If other devices charge during sleep and awake, another option could be added.
