Aha, but would it be possible to boot a U-Boot instead?

Okay, I see that it doesn't have many patches, but it still has some
code that won't be acceptable upstream. What I would suggest is to
actually provide the ACPI tables rather than going Device Tree way.
Also note, that GPIO driver has to be integrated into gpio-pxa.c which
is the historical parent IP of the Medfield case (it was a mistake to
have a separate driver to begin with).

U-Boot would be ideal to have flashed there instead of so called
bootstub (which is 4k or 8k blob to load kernel and initrd and pass
the execution to it).

True.

P.S. I'm on a long leave, but I can help you with the stuff to be
upstreamed and tested, we still have a device available to test in our
lab. Just see above.
