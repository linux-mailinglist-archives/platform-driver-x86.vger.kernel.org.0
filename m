I'm not sure what that second const gains us here so I'd prefer removing=20
it.

It's a local variable so it doesn't look like protecting the variable=20
itself with const is that important (in contrast to things which are in=20
global scope where const for the variable too is good).

Are you aware of scripts/checkpatch.pl? I think it would have caught this=
=20
(if one remembers to run it before sending patches, which is the hardest=20
part with that tool :-)).
