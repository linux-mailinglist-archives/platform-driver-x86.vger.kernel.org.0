I don't understand this.  It looks like if this driver is loaded it
instantly grabs the first iomem resource it can find and assumes that
this is the device in the system.  Where does it check to verify that
the hardware really is present?

And this isn't really a platform device, so why is it written like one?
Just because it is using the mfd subsystem?

PCIe devices are not platform devices, please use the real pci device
structures for this type of thing.

thanks,
