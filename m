Hi Mark, thanks for the feedback - much appreciated.

It is, but I certainly could have done a better job of explaining
context there rather than throwing it in (particularly given the
uselessness of the cover letter there, I forgot about that - sorry).
That series contains an i2c driver that binds to the TPS68470 when
enumerated via ACPI. That i2c driver is effectively an MFD driver, it
registers a regmap plus platform devices for the GPIO, clk, regulator
and OpRegion parts of the TPS68470, each of which has their own platform
driver to control them (though only the GPIO and OpRegion ones are
currently upstream - I need to post the clk and regulator ones), all
sharing the same regmap. This series is a follow on from that,
attempting to remedy problems with the ACPI that prevent those resources
from being discoverable by consumers on some devices.

Like of_nodes, but defined entirely within kernel code rather than
parsed out of devicetree or from ACPI. I think we need to use them to
make up for the deficiencies in ACPI on these platforms.

I went with this approach because the ACPI isn't entirely lacking, it
enumerates the TPS68470 as an i2c device for its driver to bind to
without a problem which results in the regulator driver registering the
regulator devices (7 of them for this chip), so I was thinking along the
lines of repairing the problems with ACPI to give those rdevs the right
init_data rather than sidestepping it altogether. I could register the
platform devices for the regulator driver to bind to in a board file
instead if that's the preferred option...usually this would involve
using i2c_board_info I think but as ACPI will enumerate the i2c device
for the chip independently we'd need to handle that somehow to stop them
racing each other I guess.


I'll take a look and see if I can make it work that way.

Hope this is a bit clearer now?
