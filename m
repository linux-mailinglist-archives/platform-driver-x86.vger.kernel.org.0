>=20

Thanks for the explanations. Seems simple enough to fix that, as some of
the other drivers are checking battery->desc->name for "BAT0".


One thing that I keep coming back to, and was reinforced as I looked at
include/linux/power_supply.h; the generic power supply charge_type has
values that are very close to Dells, but with different names. I could
shoehorn them in, though, with the following mappings:

POWER_SUPPLY_CHARGE_TYPE_FAST,         =3D> "express" (aka ExpressCharge)
POWER_SUPPLY_CHARGE_TYPE_STANDARD,     =3D> "standard"
POWER_SUPPLY_CHARGE_TYPE_ADAPTIVE,     =3D> "adaptive"
POWER_SUPPLY_CHARGE_TYPE_CUSTOM,       =3D> "custom"
POWER_SUPPLY_CHARGE_TYPE_LONGLIFE,     =3D> "primarily_ac"

The main difference is that Primarily AC is described and documented as
slightly different than Long Life, but I suspect the result is roughly
the same thing. And the naming "Fast" and "Long Life" wouldn't match the
BIOS naming of "ExpressCharge" and "Primarily AC".

Until now I've opted to match the BIOS naming, but I'm curious what others
think before I send V3 of the patches.
