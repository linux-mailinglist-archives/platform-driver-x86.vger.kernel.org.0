So based on our recent related emails:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-media/7fc1a3fb-d300-de09-1e0d-606971560fc1@redhat.com/

I have taken another look at this.

The datasheet for the OV7251 is a bit ambiguous it names the pin as
"XSHUTDOWN" but then describes that pin as:

"reset (active low with internal pull down resistor)"

so based on the longer description of the pin I believe it would
be reasonable to patch the driver to try and get a "reset"
con-id GPIO if getting an "enable" con-id pin fails.

IMHO this would be preferably to adding more and more GPIO
remap hacks to the INT3472 code.

Regards,

Hans
