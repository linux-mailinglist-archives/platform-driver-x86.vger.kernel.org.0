I think the WMI driver for the WMAX interface still has to always register=
 the platform device
since nearly all custom attributes (deepsleep, etc) work on the WMAX inter=
face.

I would prefer to have a single driver which when using the legacy WMI int=
erface will only provide
lighting features (correct me if the legacy WMI interface supports more fe=
atures) but will provide
all features when using the WMAX WMI interface.

The overhead of handling the legacy WMI interface should be acceptable sin=
ce it only provides lighting
services, so a lot of the code can be shared with the lighting code for th=
e WMAX WMI interface.

Making support for the legacy WMI interface configurable when building the=
 kernel also allows people to
trim the resource consumption should they not want legacy support.
