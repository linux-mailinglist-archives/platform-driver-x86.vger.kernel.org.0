Ok I see, thank you for clarifying this.

So as for the AMT mode, since that is Lenovo only, I guess that means
that there is no need to do call amd_pmf_update_slider() when AMT
is being disabled since at this point the firmware will have
already set the values.

Actually this seems to mean that we must ensure that the AMD-PMF
code stops touching these settings as soon as the event is received.

Which would imply killing the periodic work when an AMT off event
is received from within the event handling and then restating it
when AMT is on (and making sure the work being queued or not state
matches the AMT on/off state at driver probe time) ?

Regards,

Hans
