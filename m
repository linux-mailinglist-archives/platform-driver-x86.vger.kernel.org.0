I said this on your other driver submission, but why are you turning a
PCIe device into a set of platform devices and craming it into the MFD
subsystem?

PCIe devices are NOT platform devices.

Why not use the auxiliary bus for this thing if you have individual
drivers that need to "bind" to the different attributes that this single
PCIe device is exporting.

Or why not just fix the hardware to report individual PCIe devices, like
a sane system would do?  Has this shipped in any devices yet?  If not,
can that be fixed first?  It's just a firmware change, right?

thanks,
