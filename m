The idea behind software nodes is that individual device drivers
shouldn't care about where platform-specific data come from. They can
use the same fwnode API, regardless of whether the device is described
through OF, ACPI, or software nodes created by a board file in the
kernel. It allows grouping all platform data that should be provided by
firmware in a single place, conditioned by a DMI match, instead of
distributing DMI matches to lots of drivers.

We can't. ACPI describes the device, and that's how it's enumerated.
ACPI does provide information (as well as ACPI methods) needed by the
driver, but fails to provide all the required information. That's why a
mechanism to supplement the information provided by ACPI is needed.
