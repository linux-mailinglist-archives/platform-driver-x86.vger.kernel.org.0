I agree that the telemetry interface should be changed in a similar way.

Luckily it seems that this is not in Linus' tree yet and I'm also not
seeing it in next yet, e.g. :
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/tree/drivers/platform/x86/intel_pmt_telemetry.c
does not exist.

So we seem to still have time to also get the telemetry driver userspace API
fixed too.

I see that Andy gave his Reviewed-by for the intel_pmt_telemetry.c code.

Andy, I have some concerns about the userspace API choices made here,
see my earlier review of this patch. Do you agree with my suggestions,
or do you think it would be ok to move forward with the telemetry and
now also the crashlog API each registering their own private class
under /sys/class ?

AFAIK classes are supposed to be generic and not driver-private, so
that seems wrong to me.  Also PMC is Intel specific and vendor specific
stuff really does not belong under /sys/class AFAIK ?

Assuming there will only be one of each platform-device, then you
can just replace the PLATFORM_DEVID_AUTO param to devm_mfd_add_devices()
with PLATFORM_DEVID_NONE and the .%d.auto will go away.

So there can be multiple instances, you mean like the multiple chardevs
you add now, or can there be multiple platform-devices of the same
time instantiated through the MFD code ?

If you mean like the multiple chardevs, then yes you could add a folder
for the binary sysfs attributes replacing those, or register them
with a dynamic name with a number appended to the name.

I'm not sure that the PCI sysfs io resources are the best example,
as mentioned those mmap to actual memory-mapped io, which is somewhat
special.

For a simpler example see drivers/platform/x86/wmi-bmof.c.

The way normal sysfs binary attributes work is that they
have a read method much like the read method on a block device
where an offset into the file gets passed. So you just copy_to_user
the requested amount of data starting at offset from the in-kernel
mapped buffer to the user buffer:

static ssize_t
read_bmof(struct file *filp, struct kobject *kobj,
          struct bin_attribute *attr,
          char *buf, loff_t off, size_t count)
{
         struct bmof_priv *priv =
                 container_of(attr, struct bmof_priv, bmof_bin_attr);

         if (off < 0)
                 return -EINVAL;

         if (off >= priv->bmofdata->buffer.length)
                 return 0;

         if (count > priv->bmofdata->buffer.length - off)
                 count = priv->bmofdata->buffer.length - off;

         memcpy(buf, priv->bmofdata->buffer.pointer + off, count);
         return count;
}

The wmi_bmof code also shows how you can dynamically create and
add binary sysfs attr which allows you to add a %d postfix to the
name. Note you should always dynamically create binary sysfs attr.

There are some old static initializers for these, but AFAIK those
lead to lockdep issues.

Regards,

Hans
