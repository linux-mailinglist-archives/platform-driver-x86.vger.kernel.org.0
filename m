It does not work on X11, but it does work on Wayland (there xev also sees the 
Zenkaku/Hankaku keypress). Don't ask me why.

Also: Other DEs don't have this binding.

Yeah KDE would need a similar fix and other DEs probably too. I hoped for a 
generic fix that does not need adjustments in so many projects.

My first try was to do it on the XKB level but on Wayland the RedirectKey action 
is not implemented 
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xkeyboard-config/xkeyboard-config/-/merge_requests/794#note_2803713 
(and probably wont be even in the future 
https://github.com/xkbcommon/libxkbcommon/issues/18#issuecomment-72728366) so I 
can't "unpress" control and super.

If it is a more general issue, why not fix it on a more general level in the 
kernel? Maybe a generic filter applyable via a command line quirk and/or a quirk 
list?

Maybe, I didn't try. Was convenient to just do it here since I already had the 
filter. Will look into it once it is decided what to do with the touchpad toggle 
issue.
