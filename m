Hi,

So as usual I will split my remarks in 2 parts,
this first email will focus on the sysfs bits.

I will do a detailed review of the code coming Monday.

Things are starting to look pretty good now to me, good work.

This list seems to miss a "type" sysfs attribute, which tells which type
the firmware-attribute in question is. Sorry for not noticing that sooner.

Can you indent the continuation on the second line to align with the start
of the description on the first line please?, e.g.:

		current_value:	A file that can be read to obtain the current
				value of the <attr>

This goes for all the sysfs-attribute description texts.

As non-native English speaker I had to lookup semi-colon to make sure that
it indeed is ';' as I already sorta expected. So can we add "(';')" (without
the "") behind the semi-colon to make this easier to parse for non-native English
speakers?

Can we have an example here? I guess if for some reason only even/odd values
are allowed then this would contain "2" ?

So I have been taking a look at a community written driven to allow changing
BIOS-settings / firmware-attributes on some Lenovo laptops:

https://github.com/iksaif/thinkpad-wmi

My main reason for doing so is to check if other vendors also support things
like "display_name", "default_value", etc.

So for the normal attributes, it seems that for the Thinkpad WMI interface they
are all enums and the do contain possible_values. So that is fine.

But they do not have a separate display_name only a name-name, nor do they
have a default_value.

So I think we should mark the display_name, display_name_language_code and
default_value sysfs-attributes optional, e.g. make the description look like this:

		default_value:	An optional file that can be read to obtain the
				default value of the <attr>

First of all some generic remarks:

Currently the "Admin" and "System" names come directly from the Dell WMI
interface. I have 2 concerns with this:

1) What if we do get multiple authentication mechanisms for a single user,
e.g. both a type == "pasword" and type == "hotp" authentication. The way I have
been thinking about that sofar, is that we then get 2 admin dirs under the
/sys/class/firmware-attributes/*/authentication dir, with a type attribute
per dir, following how we do the attributes. So we would get e.g. these 2 dirs:

/sys/class/firmware-attributes/dell/authentication/admin-password
/sys/class/firmware-attributes/dell/authentication/admin-hotp

For the admin user. If want to do it like this in the future we should
add some indirection between the WMI username and the dir which is created
now and create the Admin dir as admin-password starting now.

2) The "Admin" name is clear enough, but the "System" name is somewhat
ambiguous and other vendors may call this differently, I think I have
at least seen it called the "User" password in some cases and Lenovo
seems to call it a power-on-password. I think that just calling it the
"boot" password makes sense. My main concern is that "System" is a bit
too vague. So then for now we would get:

/sys/class/firmware-attributes/dell/authentication/admin-password
/sys/class/firmware-attributes/dell/authentication/boot-password

The spec. should also specify that the part before the first '-' is the
username, and the part after it is the authentication type. E.g. the
docs for this could look something like this:

	Directories under /sys/class/firmware-attributes/*/authentication/
	use the following directory-name pattern:
	<username>-<authentication_method>

	Where username must be one of: "admin" or "boot":

	admin	If any authentication_method is enabled for the admin user, then
		authentication as the admin user is required to modify BIOS settings.
	boot	If any authentication_method is enabled for the admin user, then
		authentication as the boot user is required to boot the machine.

	And where authentication_method must be "password". Note in the future
	both more usernames and more authentication_method-s may be added.

	All authentication_methods must have the following sysfs-attributes:

	is_enabled:  This reads "1" if the authentication_method is enabled,
		     and "0" if its disabled

	Any changes to authentication_methods will generate a change uevent,
	upon receiving this event applications should recheck the authentication
	settings such as the is_enabled flag.

	Password authentication_method specific sysfs-attributes:

	max_password_length: ... (continue with the old text)

Note:

1) This is a proposal to make the authentication bits a bit more generic /
    future proof. This is very much open for discussion.

2) The new generic is_enabled sysfs-attribute replaces the is_authentication_set flag

###

So as with the actual firmware-attributes I have also been comparing the authentication
bits for the Dell case with the community thinkpad_wmi code. And again things are a pretty
good match already, including being able to query a minimum and maximin password length.

The only thing which is different, which I think would be good to add now, is
a password_encoding sysfs-attribute. The Lenovo password interface supports
2 encodings, "ascii" and "scancodes". Although I wonder if scancodes still
works on modern UEFI based platforms.

Since the Dell password code uses UTF8 to UTF16 translation routines, I guess
the encoding for the Dell password is UTF8 (at the sysfs level). So I would like to propose
an extra password-authentication attribute like:

	password_encoding:  A file that can be read to obtain the encoding used by
			    the current_password and new_password attributes.
			    The value returned should be one of: "utf8", "ascii".
			    In some cases this may return a vendor-specific encoding
			    like, e.g. "lenovo-scancodes".

And for the Dell driver this would just be hardcoded to utf8.

I think that this bit can be dropped both the new authentication text which I suggest
above, but even the old text:

Already makes it clear that if an Admin password is set modification of (any)
BIOS settings is not allowed without the password. So this seems redundant.

If in the future some attributes can be changed without the Admin password,
then we can deal with that then by introducing a new authorization_required
attribute, which could contain, e.g. one of "none, "admin", "<new-to-be-defined
-power-user-level-user>".

And when we define that optional attribute then we add that the absence of
said attribute means that the consumer of the API should behave as if the
authorization_requires attribute contains "admin", which existing API consumers
will already do as that is the behavior we define currently.
