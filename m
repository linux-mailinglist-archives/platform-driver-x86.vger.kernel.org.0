The WMI driver inside the attachment should be a suitable starting point.
You can also reuse the same driver for many different GUIDs and do the fol=
lowing:

- use the context inside the wmi_device_id to find out which GUID is being=
 probed.
You can use drivers/platform/x86/xiaomi-wmi.c as an example.

- inside the .notify callback parse the event data and the call the notifi=
er.
You can use the action parameter to signal which kind of WMI event was rec=
eived (SMART_FAN_MODE_EVENT, ...)
and the data parameter to pass the event data.

With this you only need to provide a single WMI driver.

The lenovo-wmi-gamezone driver can then register with this notifier and li=
sten for
platform profile changes:

	static int lenovo_gz_notify_call(struct notifier_block *nb, unsigned long=
 action, void *data)
         {
                 if (action !=3D SMART_FAN_MODE_EVENT)	// Filter events
                         return NOTIFY_DONE;

		<check *data if necessary>

                 platform_profile_cycle();	// Cycle platform profile if ne=
cessary

                 return NOTIFY_OK;
         }

Your approach would have a problem: how to communicate the initial platfor=
m profile state
when lenovo-wmi-other probes?

I suggest that lenovo-wmi-gamezone stores the current platform profile. Th=
is value can then
be retrieved by lenovo-wmi-other by using the special gamezone notifier. T=
his would also allow
lenovo-wmi-other to detect when lenovo-wmi-gamezone is not ready and can t=
hus not provide
platform profile data.

Armin Wolf
