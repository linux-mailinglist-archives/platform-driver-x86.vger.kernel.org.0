Thank you.

Looking at kbuild bot errors, it seems I managed to somehow mess up
again. It is not true that just the [08/10] patch relies on the
psy-olpc-1.75-battery-signed branch of power-supply tree (see above);
in fact [03/10] also does on x86.

Would it be possible to include that branch in your testing as well? It
is going to be included in the power-supply pull for 5.2.

Also, it seems patches [09/10] and [10/10] landed in your queue; they
are not ready.

Lubo
