Right, so Gerardo, I guess the laptop keyboard will have
some special hotkeys (possibly in combination with the "Fn")
keys as shortcuts for various things.

It would be good if you can verify that all those hotkeys
generate events.

What you can do is run "sudo evemu-record" and then select e.g.
first the "AT Translated Set 2 keyboard" device and see which
(special hotkey) keys generate events there. Then strike those
of the list to check and next check the "Dell WMI hotkeys"
device and see if any hotkeys report events there.

Note the display brightness up/down hotkeys might very well be
delivered through the "Video Bus" event. More in general you may
have some other input devices which deal with some of the hotkeys.

Regards,

Hans
