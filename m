Understood. But lets see if I understand fully:

The key part is "pwmX_auto_pointN_temp and pwmX_auto_pointN_pwm", with 
X being a profile, and N the point in the curve graph. If I use this 
format I have:

- 3 profiles
- each profile has two fans
- each fan has 8 points on it
- each point has 2 integers

so that makes for a total of 96 individual sysfs paths. Is that really 
okay? And where would the new paths god?
- Under /sys/devices/platform/asus-nb-wmi/ still, or
- /sys/devices/platform/asus-nb-wmi/hwmon/ ?

I'm currently using SENSOR_DEVICE_ATTR_2_RW with index = profile, nr = 
fan. If there weren't profiles involved then I could see it being 
easily achieved with that.. Maybe I could use the index(profile) with a 
mask to get the fan number.

I've done all the groundwork for it at least, so it can certainly be 
done. My only worry is that because of the sheer number of sysfs paths 
being added (96) it could become unwieldy to use.

Could I use the existing method + the above?

Many thanks,
Luke.
