Honestly, that feels wrong to me.

There are non-Apple products with Thunderbolt controllers,
e.g. Supermicro X10SAT was a Xeon board with Redwood Ridge
which was introduced in 2013.  This was way before Microsoft
came up with the HotPlugSupportInD3 property.  It was also way
before the 2015 BIOS cut-off date that we use to disable
power management on older boards.

Still, we currently whitelist the Thunderbolt ports on that
board for D3 because we know it works.  What if products like
this one use their own power management scheme and we'd cause
a power regression if we needlessly disable D3 for them now?

Thanks,

Lukas
