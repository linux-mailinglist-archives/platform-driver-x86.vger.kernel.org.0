I believe that the GPIO is connected to a general "Enable/Disable cameras"=
 button, but if the GPIO
is indeed connected to some sort of lens cover then i agree with sending "=
SW_CAMERA_LENS_COVER".

I agree with you here regarding the "dropping the camera of the bus" type =
of devices.

However we might need to differentiate between buttons which are designed =
to:

- disable all cameras (like some sort of configuration shortcut)

- notify that the camera was disabled (and possible dropped of the bus)

In the first case i would continue to use KEY_CAMERA_ACCESS_[DIS|EN]ABLE, =
while in the second
case we could indeed use SW_CAMERA_LENS_COVER. The point is that we need t=
o know the purpose of the
button/event.

Thanks,
Armin Wolf
