Ok. So how much information is available over WMI? Exposing the
max. input power via the power-supply API makes sense in any case.

I agree. WMI and ACPI information need to be merged and exposed
as one device to userspace. It's not the first time we have this
kind of requirement, but so far it was about merging battery info
=66rom two places. Unfortunately no code has been written so far to
support this.

I don't think this is a good idea. It brings all kind of
localization problems. Also the information is not machine
parsable. It looks more like a hack to get things working
quickly by avoiding using/designing proper APIs.
