If a device needs access to platform resources, then it is a platform
device.  If not, then it is not.  Not too complex :)

But (you knew there was a but), many drivers want to detach their
ability to create a device, and have a driver bind to them, in a
different "place" in the kernel.  For many of those, they have (ab)used
the platform driver/device api to achieve this, despite them not being a
platform device at all.  For these, we can't convert them directly to
use faux bus, as it's not as simple of a conversion and in some places,
doesn't work well.  So let's leave those alone for now, but not take any
more of them going forward in the future.

hope this helps,
