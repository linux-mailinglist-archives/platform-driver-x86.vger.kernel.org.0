Just to clarify the software sequencer was used in "recent" Atoms
(Baytrail, Braswell and I think its successor too). After Broxton I
think it all is now hardware sequencer only. AFAIK those are still used
in embedded world so we should keep the support in the driver but that
support can be put under the "DANGEROUS" KConfig option.
