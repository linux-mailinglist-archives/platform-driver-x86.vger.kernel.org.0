--- Comment #280 from Jeroen Beerstra (jeroen@beerstra.org) ---
(In reply to Denis Pauk from comment #278)

I was succesfull in enabling the monitoring for my Asus X670-P motherboard =
on
kernel 6.1.2 running on Almalinux. First of all I added my board to DMI sec=
tion
of you r patch and second I added it to asus_wmi_sensors. The patch didn't
apply fully though on ML linux but manually editing nct6775-platform was
trivial for me (I just needed to add Asus X670-P to the list and didn't bot=
her
to sort out the differences in the list from the patch and linux 6.1.2). I
still need to modprobe nct6775 and lmsensors doesn't detect my sensors OOTB.
But the module loads cleanly and I see sensors readings :)

Not all is correct (for example one of the 2 case fans is missing from the
