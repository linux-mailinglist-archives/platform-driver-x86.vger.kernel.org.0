How can we be sure that this won't be forgotten? How can we be sure it
will be public at the end? Please, elaborate this in the commit
message.

Can it be done in another file module at least (let's say intel_pmt_quirks.c)?

I'm not a fan of cargo cult when there is no understanding why certain
code appears in the driver.

Right.

PFN_PHYS() is a replacement for multiplication. You may check its
implementation.

This is not understandable from 'no data buffer' above. Can you
elaborate in the comment?

Right. Above is the leftover that shows the poor testing of v7.

Please, read again what I wrote below. Ditto for other inclusions.

types.h not necessarily be included by above and so on...
