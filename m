Probably it will be harmless, but I think the Display On being done
twice, and one of the times being inside the suspend sequence might
result in sub-optimal behavior. Well, the behavior that exists now.

Refer to [1]. CSEE with B7, B8 is in fact the _DSM 3,4 Display On/Off
internal call. There is also a spurious Lid switch call on Display On
that does not exist and causes dmesg errors.

All are fair comments. I will fix them on the next revision.

On the Patch 3 comment, do you think there is merit with blending the
quirk with userspace freezing? Moving it inside LPS0 would make that
difficult, however at the same time 500ms for just the Ally (and
perhaps 2-3 other affected devices) is not something particularly
noticeable anyway.
