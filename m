Hmm,
A change via /sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile does disable the 
fan-curve until a user re-enables it.
It doesn't wipe the actual curve setting though, I thought that would 
be bad UX, but yes the curve is definitely disabled on profile change 
and will remain disabled until turned on again. At which point another 
profile change will disable it again.

And as stated in previous reply use of 
/sys/devices/platform/asus-nb-wmi/hwmon/hwmon<N>/pwm<N>_enable to check 
the status is stabilised (1 = manual fan).

Looking at it with fresh eyes I just spotted some things I can clean up 
further. Very sorry, there'll be a v15 :(

Many thanks,
Luke.
