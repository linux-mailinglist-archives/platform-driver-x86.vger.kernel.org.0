--- Comment #50 from Pedro (voidpointertonull+kernelorgbugzilla@gmail.com) =
---
Coming from Bug #217931 , I found the mentions of being stuck at low freque=
ncy
odd as I couldn't observe that despite managing multiple hosts, but then he=
re I
am.

The twist is that I have a 7950X3D desktop setup, not a laptop one, and I
apparently I just ran into the same low frequency issue others experienced.
Unfortunately the usefulness of my information will be limited as I'm on a =
not
really customized Kubuntu 23.10 setup with kernel 6.5.0 , but on the other =
hand
I haven't touched anything relevant, not even setting a frequency limit.

I'm observing the CPU being stuck in the 400 MHz - 549 MHz range which is q=
uite
fitting for this bug report, and the host was never suspended / hibernated.
The only relevant oddity I've found so far is that
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu4/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq was sticking out like=
 a
sore thumb with 400000 set while other cores had the value of 5759000, but
changing that didn't make a difference.

Not really sure when did this manifest itself, but highly likely after (or
during?) a case of Bug #204253 as I brushed away the slowness for a while as
the usual heavy I/O (over NFS) problem which even used to freeze the desktop
for more than a minute on a weaker setup, but the current higher performance
CPU seemed to take it better, although the experience was still disruptive.
Is this really a laptop bug then instead of a more generic problem with a l=
arge
stutter causing some logic to get upset possibly due to timing problems? He=
avy
CPU usage alone surely doesn't do the trick as I've seen hosts doing fine w=
ith
that, but heavy I/O seems more brutal with possibly similar "world stopping
power" as suspending.
