Ah, yes.

I'd like to fix it in the next revision. Looking forward to your
progress in debugging :-)

It seems to me that the corresponding ACPI method did not return 1 on
success. There should be some clues in the decompiled ASL code. Could
you attach it in your reply? The HWMON implementation was developed
mostly based on my understanding on the decompiled ASL code of my
device. I'd like to check the one of your device as a cross-reference
to see if there are more potential bugs.

> As it seems that you can change the RPM in 100 increments,

Yeah. That's also true on my device, but I am not sure if all devices
with the interface behave like this. I'd prefer not making such an
assumption.

For pwmY, I don't see the point why the kernel should adapt to
userspace tools... If we don't have to, don't be overfit.

For pwmY_enable, it is only a good choice if we adopt pwmY. It's weird
to mix pwmY_enable and fanY_target.

@Derek, may I ask for your opinion here? Should we adopt pwmY*?

If we adopt this, I could imagine three ways to create a PWM-RPM curve:
(1) PWM[0,255] =3D> RPM[min,max]
(2) PWM[0,255] =3D> RPM[0,max]
(3) PWM[0,255] =3D> RPM[0,a_large_number]

relax_fan_constraint=3D1 definitely needs (3) as the fan can spin
slower/faster than min/max_rpm. I don't want to create scale mismatches
between relax_fan_constraint=3D1 and =3D0, so only (3) looks viable to me
in any case. Hmm, we are creating a weird PWM-RPM curve with two
plateau [1].

Happy hacking :P

ThinkBook (my device) only implements few Legion interfaces, so your
information here is very valuable.
