I agree that adding debugfs support just for a single file seems a bit overkill.

> This feature is mostly used internally (which is fine) but we have had occasions where we've used it with customers; and with the WMI interface it's usually the enterprise customers who do have secure boot enabled. I'd like to avoid that limitation if possible.

So given that using debugfs seems a bit overkill and it has issues with
selinux I think that it might be best to hide this file behind a module
option (and mention that in the docs, or maybe not document it at all?).

At least for now kernel commandline options an be set without breaking
secureboot and even if secureboot ever starts verifying the cmdline then
we can always use a /etc/modprobe.d/*.conf file to specify the option
instead of passing it through the kernel cmdline.

Would using a module option to enable the debug_cmd file
work for you ?

Regards,

Hans
