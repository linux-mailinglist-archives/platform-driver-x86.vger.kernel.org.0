Interesting. So what I get from this is that we really only want
force_discharge support. At least that is the major one. So maybe
we should focus on just that one.

Anyways lets wait and see what Mark has to say about this. As
I mentioned before doing battery calibration certainly is something
which is desirable to do under Windows too, so perhaps this option
is actually fine and it was the other 2 which are more
"testing only" firmware features.

Regards,

Hans
