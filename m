Please take a look at my recent series[0].

It provides an API similar to what you propose.
Currently it does not provide an even higher level API with predefined
structs for enumeration attributes etc. That is intentional for now as
it is also meant to handle custom attribute types.
Nothing would prevent a creation of such a convenience API on top of my
series, however.

We'd need some coordination about landing the different patches,
but that shouldn't really be a problem.
