I tested it on a T460s with two batteries and there inhibit-charge works
fine for both batteries.
What does not work is setting force-discharge for both batteries at the same
time.
This makes somewhat sense as on a physical level probably only one of them can
be used at a time.

Mark Pearson: Could you confirm that this is the intended behaviour?

In my changes queued for v2 of the series[0] I added validation of the written
settings and an EIO is now reported if the settings were not applied, so this
should help userspace handle this situatoin.

The plan is to submit v2 after the first round of review for the core PM
changes.
