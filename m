So this all sounds like just using the WMI temperature functions as
v2 of this driver does, does sound best overall. Presumably those are also
used by Gigabyte's own Windows tool.

Although even there we have the issue of the interface possibly changing
from board to board. So even there I think we should start with a DMI
based allow-list approach for now; we can revisit this when we have a
better picture of things.

Hans
