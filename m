Yes? I see messages like this

	intel_scu_ipc intel_scu_ipc: IPC command 0x200a7 failed with -110

which led me to this driver and I wrote these patches based on that
failure message. I was trying to figure out how that could happen, and
it seems that it could simply be scheduling delays while nothing is
really timing out.

I have no idea. Is there some way to figure that out? I'm not able to
reproduce the problem locally.
