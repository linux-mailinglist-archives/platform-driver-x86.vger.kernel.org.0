Yes the notifier setup is somewhat involved. I believe posting
the v2 which you have ready to post as is is fine.

Assuming that with "this driver" you mean the Yoga Tablet Mode switch
driver you are working on that already is a WMI BUS driver since
it is a wmi_driver which attached itself to a wmi_device.

The old way of doing things was with drivers which instantiated
their own platform_device-s and then attached to those. These
used the old specify a WMI object to operate on through GUID only
methods like wmi_evaluate_method() everywhere.
