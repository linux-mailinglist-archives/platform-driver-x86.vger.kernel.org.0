I am unable to set the color/mode on my TUF FX505 laptop. Upon investigation of the asus-wmi driver, I can see a correct implementation of the color setting functionality (based on my own reverse engineering) however writing to the appropriate /sys/class/leds device does not work. Upon further investigation it seems to have to do withÂ asus-wmi.c:747 where cmd = !!cmd is done. On my specific laptop the WMI interface expects the magic value 0xB3 however it is impossible to write this value as any positive value will be replaced by 1.


Best regards,
Kristiyan
