There was a special WMI interface that reads all sensors, both from SIO and=
 EC,
kind implementing what you did for the nct driver and what is implemented in
the asus-wmi-ec-sensors, but done fully in the DSDT code.=20

> new one always returns zero as count of sensors

There is simply no that high-level WMI interface in the new boards.

I now think the EC sensors are at the same registers for the old and new
boards.=20=20

> And list of old and new boards is not intersected.=20

Exactly! So half the driver will be a dead code anyway. Would it be better =
to
load only one of the small drivers? Also, for the old boards the nct6775 dr=
iver
will load and asus-wmi-sensors provides duplicate readings.=20=20

> As for me, when we have 30% of similar code better have one driver for bo=
th

The only shared code between those two is the HWMON interface functions, wh=
ich
is more or less the same for many HWMON drivers.=20

So, would it be simpler to provide 3 drivers: nct6775, asus-wmi-sensors,
asus-wmi-ec-sensors?

> Do you like to be in MAINTAINERS list?

Yes, please. I still have work to do with that (even not all available sens=
ors
are discovered yet).
