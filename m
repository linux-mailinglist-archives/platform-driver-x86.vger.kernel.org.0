I had something like the following in mind:

  int err =3D 0;
  /* ... */
  obj =3D output.pointer;
  if (!obj)
    return -ENODATA;

  switch (obj->type) {
  case ACPI_TYPE_BUFFER:
    if (obj->buffer.length < size)
      err =3D -ENODATA;
    else if (obj->buffer.length > size)
      err =3D -ENOSPC;
    else
      memcpy(ret_buffer, obj->buffer.pointer, size);
    break;
  case ACPI_TYPE_INTEGER:
    switch (obj->integer.value) {
      case ASUS_WMI_UNSUPPORTED_METHOD:
        err =3D -EOPNOTSUPP;
=09break;
      default:
        err =3D -ENODATA;
=09break;
    }
    break;
  default:
    err =3D -ENODATA;
    break;
  }

  kfree(obj);

  return err;

The, unfortunately, that is not as simple as I initially thought...

If there was a method to set a fan curve, and one to retrieve it,
I would suggest just exposing that via the pwmN_auto_pointM_{pwm,temp}
attributes on a hwmon device, and that the profile-dependent switching
be implemented somewhere else. As far as I see, there is already
existing infrastructure for integrating such a feature [0]
(but please correct me if I'm wrong).

This would simplify the kernel code, add no new ABI, and
potentially provide greater control over policy for the
user space.

I assume there isn't a method that can query
the current fan curve (or it is unknown)?
