Right, but both offer the same information / functionality right (except for the missing max rpm).

So unless I am missing something if both drivers are loaded then there will be 2 hwmon devices registered with duplicate functionality?

If I have understood that correctly then the WMI interface really should be hidden (the WMI drivers' probe() can simply return -ENODEV without doing anything) when the ACPI interface is there.

We do NOT want 2 hwmon devices with duplicate functionality.
