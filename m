It looks like this series causes allyesconfig to break on linux-next:

https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/continuous-integration2/runs/2773158286?check_suite_focus=true

ld: drivers/platform/x86/think-lmi.o:(.bss+0x0): multiple definition of `fw_attr_class'; drivers/platform/x86/dell/dell-wmi-sysman/sysman.o:(.bss+0x0): first defined here
