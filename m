--- Comment #38 from Jaap de Haan (jaap.dehaan@freenet.de) ---
CONFIG_ASUS_WMI=3Dm andI confirmed the module is loaded.

I think I saw some improvements lastly in the support of temperature sensor=
s, I
am not so sure because I have no traces of the old state and it's a long ti=
me
ago I used the UI. I flashed my BIOS recently and hoped things would be sol=
ved
with that action.

Thanks a lot Matthew for this good explanation and for the first time I
understood (at abstract level) what is going on and why it is so. This
explanation is something really valuable to be kept and put in a prominent
place like kernel Documentation and a known issues text file (then a less a=
sus
specific explanation) IMO.

I was nearly as desperate to try to use the `acpi_enforce_resources=3Dlax`
setting but without understanding it is for me as an engineer something "ho=
t"
and now I really get why it is so, I will for my part keep my fingers away =
from
the setting and hope that someone will find out how to get the FAN values in
the normal driver.

Many thanks for the clarification.
