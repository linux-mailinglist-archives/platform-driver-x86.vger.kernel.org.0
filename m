Right, I tried, but that doesn't gives the result I want, for example:

Evaluating \CRHW.HWID
0x1 Outstanding allocations after evaluation of \CRHW.HWID
Evaluation of \CRHW.HWID returned object 0x55b9e373fd60, external buffer length 38
  [Package] Contains 1 Elements:
    [String] Length 00 = ""


I found that the VBTx are addresses setup in the following file.

src/vendorcode/google/chromeos/acpi/gnvs.asl:

VBT0,   32,     // 0x000 - Boot Reason
VBT1,   32,     // 0x004 - Active Main Firmware
VBT2,   32,     // 0x008 - Active EC Firmware
VBT3,   16,     // 0x00c - CHSW
VBT4, 2048,     // 0x00e - HWID
VBT5,  512,     // 0x10e - FWID
VBT6,  512,     // 0x14e - FRID
VBT7,   32,     // 0x18e - active main firmware type
VBT8,   32,     // 0x192 - Recovery Reason
VBT9,   32,     // 0x196 - FMAP base address
CHVD, 24576,    // 0x19a - VDAT space filled by verified boot
VBTA,   32,     // 0xd9a - pointer to smbios FWID
MEHH,  256,     // 0xd9e - Management Engine Hash
RMOB,   32,     // 0xdbe - RAM oops base address
RMOL,   32,     // 0xdc2 - RAM oops length
ROVP,   32,     // 0xdc6 - pointer to RO_VPD
ROVL,   32,     // 0xdca - size of RO_VPD
RWVP,   32,     // 0xdce - pointer to RW_VPD
RWVL,   32,     // 0xdd2 - size of RW_VPD
                // 0xdd6

Can I assume that the info I want is only accessible in runtime and is not
exported via the static tables?

Thanks,
 Enric
