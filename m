Because it is very hard to access the SPI flash to read the BIOS 
contents for (security) analysis and this works without the more complex 
and unfinished SPI drivers and it does so on a system where we may not 
access the full /dev/mem.

Sorry, but I went through tons of code and could not find a single 
instance where I can use a default group for creation without using a 
probe function that does the magic for me. Please help me find the 
correct way of doing this without manually creating and adding kobjects.

I ave already proven that it works on all x64 Intel platforms here [1]. 
It nearly impossible to prove for AMD b/c of the lack of documentation, 
but we tested it on several old Bulldozer system and so far the memory 
was always mapped. I feel that adding more hardware detection just adds 
complexity. Anyway, what do you suggest? Use CPUID to check if the 
vendor is AMD or Intel?
