The firmware-attribute class interface is only intended for attributes whi=
ch are persistent
and cannot be exposed over other subsystem interfaces.

The "current_value" attribute can be exposed using the hwmon subsystem. Al=
so i assume that
the setting is not persistent across reboots (correct me if i am wrong).

Also depending on the driver the path will be:

/sys/class/firmware-attributes/<name>/attributes/<attr name>/current_value

Because of this i think having a separate interface for each driver is bet=
ter. We can of course harmonize
the naming of the attributes where it makes sense.

I would prefer approach d. Ideally each driver would use standard subsyste=
m interfaces (hwmon, backlight, firmware-attributes, platform-profile, etc=
)
so that userspace software can be written in a driver-agnostic way.

I agree.

Oh no.

I hope that we just misinterpret the result of those methods. Otherwise th=
is would indeed be
very frustrating. Maybe some help from Lenovo can solve this issue.
