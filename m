Ok, so basically in all cases we have working backlight control
and with "native", which is the default without quirks we get only
1 interface (so no userspace confusion possible) and that interface
has a better range then the acpi_video0 one which gets enabled
by the acpi_backlight=video option.

Also interesting here is that acpi_backlight=vendor is actually
not resulting in a "asus-nb-wmi" dir showing up under /sys/class/backlight
as it should. Which means that the Asus WMI interface on this model
does not support backlight control through the WMI interface at all.

Which matches my initial reaction of finding it very strange that
a vendor specific interface would be used for this in 2020/2021.

What I think is happening here is that depending on the BIOS setting
for which GPU to use, there might not be any native backlight interface
at all. IOW if that BIOS setting is set to nvidia only then
/sys/class/backlight/amdgpu_bl0 goes away and when nouveau is not
used /blacklisted it will not be replaced by a /sys/class/backlight/nouveau...
native interface.

The kernel-code which deals with selecting which backlight interface(s)
to register then notices there is no native backlight driver and thus
will allow the acpi_video0 interface to register; and I guess that
that interface is not working when the BIOS setting is set to only
use (or prefer) the nvidia GPU.

And I guess this showing up of the non-working
/sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0 interface is causing userspace
to prefer that over whatever mechanism the nvidia binary driver
is using to allow control over the backlight.

So, the quirks which have been added so far, which do the
equivalent of passing acpi_backlight=vendor on the cmdline are
not enabling the "vendor" (Asus) backlight interface at all,
instead all they are doing is disabling the auto backlight selection
code in the kernel which, without the quirk, automatically behaves
as if acpi_backlight=video is specified when no native backlight
interfaces are registered.

I think a couple of users first need to run some more tests to
confirm all this (with the nvidia GPU enabled and while using
the nvidia binary driver).

Then once we have this confirmed, the proper fix is to add
a quirk (with the generic model matching from your patch)
to set acpi_backlight=native by calling the
video_detect_force_native() callback from the DMI entries
in the video_detect_dmi_table[] in drivers/acpi/video_detect.c

The entries for this should be added at the end of the list
of models already using the video_detect_force_native() callback,
so around line 387, just before this comment block:

        /*
         * Desktops which falsely report a backlight and which our heuristics
         * for this do not catch.
         */

And then once that change has landed upstream, the existing
quirks for this can be dropped from the asus-nb-wmi.c code.

But first we need more testing / logs to confirm my theory here.

No that is not necessary, the quirk does the equivalent of passing
acpi_backlight=vendor and the kernel-commandline setting
trumps (overrides) the DMI quirk.

Correct.
