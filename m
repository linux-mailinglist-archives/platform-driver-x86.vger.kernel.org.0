--- Comment #4 from madcatx@atlas.cz ---
I modded the driver to log the events, here's the output. Note that I log a=
ll
events and have an extra output for the THM event so the output is a bit
noisier that necessary.

There doesn't seem to be anything hammering the toggle, it just switches it=
self
back to "low-power".

There doesn't seem to be any apparent pattern that would provoke this. All I
can tell is that the power profile seems to switch itself back from
"performance" to "low-power" after some time. It can take anywhere from 5 t=
o 70
seconds for this to happen.

It also looks like the "balanced" profile seems to stick but I need to veri=
fy
this better.
