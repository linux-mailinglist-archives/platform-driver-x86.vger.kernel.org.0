TEE driver feeds in a lot of metadata and the structure information
for PSP headers and I don't think just having a request_firmware()
will help.

Sidebar, TEE driver has a lot of plumbing that can be used decrypt the
policy binaries to debug issues related to TA load failures and policy
binary issues (basically the descriptors)

So we might end up in replicating a majority of TEE code into PMF
driver, which might not be a good design choice.

Let me first talk to internal folks to see if we can solve it by not
making complex changes.

Shyam
