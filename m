Even if all vendors would issue BIOs updates for this for all models
(which they won't) then we still cannot count on users installing those
BIOS updates. Because of this relying on a BIOS update is almost never the
right answer.

(Note I guess there might be some extreme circumstans / some corner case where
things are so broken that we will tell users to just upgrade their BIOS)

The issue is that we cannot detect the presence of a LCD panel from the
ACPI-video code. That is done by the i915 driver (on these devices) and
we really don't want any (more) dependencies between the acpi-video code
and the i915 code as those are very hard to manage wrt things like the
probing order. Also the ACPI-video code is supposed to be platform and
even architecture independent.

Hans
