Wow! This is surprising.
Can you tell more about your test environment? What is the Linux
kernel version in use and what is the userspace (AOSP, Buildroot,
Yocto, custom)? If custom, more details would be nice to hear.

That would also be nice to hear in detail. With other Intel MID
platforms the decision was made to pursue ACPI (and U-Boot, as an
example) supports that for Intel Merrifield platform.

I'm not against a patch if it helps existing users, but we need to
understand first if it will be really helpful for upstream (taking
into account 32-bit Intel MID support removal).
