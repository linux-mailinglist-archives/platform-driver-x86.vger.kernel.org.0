Ok, let's try it. Booting on a couple of boxes looks ok here, the
difference is visible:

-  DMA zone: 30 pages reserved
+  DMA zone: 159 pages reserved

On the other box, it was already reserving so many pages even before

  DMA zone: 159 pages reserved

i.e., the first 640K.

But it's not like I had problems before with early reservations so my
testing doesn't mean a whole lot. Hugh's testing sounds good, lemme add
his tag too.

Thx.
