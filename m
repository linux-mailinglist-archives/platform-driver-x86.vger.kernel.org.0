Having U-Boot support would be nice. But since I don't have a good way
to debug the boot procedure on my device and the 5.10 mainline kernel
just booted out of the box with working USB and eMMC drivers, it was a
much easier way to go.

The primary reason I chose to use devicetree was that the required
drivers already have devicetree bindings (maxtouch, max17042 and
wl1271). Also, I'm not really familiar with ACPI tables and don't know
if they are flexible enough for my purposes.

I have seen your the comment in 944dcbe84b8ab7efdfcc592b6905a797324da51c

The bootstub is probably part of the "bos" partition, which also
includes the implementation of androids fastboot protocol, which I need
to reflash my device. Therefore I would rather not risk breaking it.
