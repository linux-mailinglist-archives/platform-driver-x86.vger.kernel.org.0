Thank you for your work on this.

Note that work is actually ongoing to add support for multiple kbd
backlights to upower:

https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/upower/upower/-/merge_requests/258

But that is intended for when there are 2 kbds with a controllable backlight,
e.g. a docked laptop with a gaming kbd with RGB backlight connected to the dock.

Where as here we seem to have 2 controls which ideally should be set to
the same value if I understand things correctly ?

Hmm, ideally we want this sort of policy to be in userspace, this sounds
more like it is a keycode problem and we maybe need KEY_KBDILLUMCYCLE next
to the existing KEY_KBDILLUMTOGGLE. For the existing toggle doing on/off
obviously is the correct userspace behavior.

Anyways I can see how Asus is special here and on laptops the cycling is
typically handled by the EC and we have chosen to emulate EC behavior in
the kernel before to keep things consistent amongst models.

Still generally speaking we do prefer to just send keypresses when possible
and let userspace set the policy, but I guess we can make an exception here.

I've taken a quick look at the new API between asus-wmi and asus-hid and
this looks good to me, thank you for your work on this.

Hans
