Aha, good, thanks. That went smoothly.

Yes: sometimes it is neccessary to modify the dts. I was changing the
kernel command line, for example.

I'll take a look. I tried 5.2 with defconfig from one of the branches
(olpc_xo175_defconfig), and that does not boot.

What config should I use? Is it enough to produce zImage and put it on
the flashdisk with olpc.fth file? Is there some kind of documentation
somewhere? :-).

Thanks and best regards,
