Let me try clarify things:

CnQF has 4 levels internally, between which it switches automatically
based on the workload of the last 5 minutes.

So from a userspace pov CnQF is a single setting which can be toggled
on / off.

Basically it is a more dynamic balanced mode, so I think it makes
sense for the amd-pmf code to always export a platform_profile
interface and when CnQF is on then use CnQF for balanced
and the static slider settings for low-power / performance.

And when CnQF is off, then just use what AMD calls the static slider
balanced setting.

This way for performance-profile-daemon nothing really changes.

This can then be combined with allowing the user to turn CnQF
on/off through sysfs as an extra option which p-p-d can ignore
(this sysfs file then choses between CnQF and static balanced
mode when balance is set through the platform interface).

Regards,

Hans


p.s.

Shyam I will reply to your emails in a couple of minutes.
