Why is it needed? I mean the listed blobs are not mandatory to get
system boot. Is this correct?

They are x86_32 and x86_64, so in the category you listed.

Unfortunately there is indeed not much publicly available information,
but I can tell you that from a design perspective you may consider
them PCH-less.

It's not. That address space is full of devices, the same memory can't
be used for ROM and devices at the same time (I won't go to the weird
concept of different read and write paths, and it's not applicable
here anyway).

(Semi-)wrong. Yes, _something_ is there (with the holes), but it's
_not_ a firmware memory.

You may google for iomem output on that kind of device.

For your convenience (an excerpt):

  fee00000-fee00fff : Local APIC
   fee00000-fee00fff : Reserved
 ff000000-ffffffff : Reserved
   ff008000-ff008fff : 0000:00:0c.0
     ff008000-ff008fff : 0000:00:0c.0
   ff009000-ff009fff : 0000:00:13.0
     ff009000-ff009fff : intel_scu_ipc
