Sorry, I was not really clear there, what I meant is a sysadmin doing
something like this:

cat /sys/.../crashlog-file > /mnt/external-usb-disk/server-foo-bar-crashlog20200917

So that they can easily save the crashlog for later reference without
needing to install special tools.

That was meant as a way to allow doing hardware-drivers in userspace
(think old userspace modesetting Xorg/xfree86) without needing to
call iopl and on non-x86 platforms which don't have iopl.

Ok, a few pages of data should not be an issue for a binary sysfs
file at all.

That is fine, but then at least to me, using sysfs binary files, seems to make
a lot more sense then creating multiple char devices for this.
