The whole exercise with swnode is to minimize the driver intrusion and
evolving a unified way for (some) of the device properties. V4L2 won't
like what you are suggesting exactly because they don't like the idea
of spreading the board code over the drivers. In some cases it might
even be not so straightforward and easy.

Laurent, do I understand correctly the v4l2 expectations?
