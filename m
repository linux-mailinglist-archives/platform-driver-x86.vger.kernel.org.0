I don't think this is about requesting a cherry-pick though.

This patch is based on the mainline.  The requisite commit has been
included into the Linus' tree since at least 6.1-rc4 AFAICS and I
suppose that it has been tested on top of that.

You could in principle create a temporary branch based on 6.1-rc4 (or
a later -rc), apply the patch on top of it, merge your current branch
on top of that and merge it back into your current branch (that should
result in a fast-forward merge, so the temporary branch can be deleted
after it).

I do such things on a regular basis and no complaints so far.

Cheers!
