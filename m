I'm afraid that making this change is not as straight forward as it looks.

I know that I have tried to do this in the past and it failed.

IIRC there were 3 problems:

1. I was expecting this to also allow the driver for the instantiated
i2c-client to be able to bind using an acpi_match_table but that
unfortunately does not work. acpi_match_table matches only work for
the first physical_node linked under
/sys/bus/acpi/devices/xxxx:xx/physical_node and that is the platform
device to which serial-multi-instantiate.c binds. The i2c_client becomes
the second physical node.  Note this is not really an issue,
just something to be aware of.


2. This causes the i2c-core to use the first IRQ resource in the ACPI
fwnode as client->irq for any clients for which we do not set an
IRQ when instantiating. Which may very well be wrong. Sometimes that
IRQ is only valid for the first i2c-client which we instantiate; and
not for the others! And sometimes it is a problem because it may
point to an irqchip for which we never wrote a driver leading to
all probes of the i2c-client failing with -EPROBE_DEFER, see:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=d1d84bb95364ed604015c2b788caaf3dbca0262f

Note that patch has been reverted since that specific -EPROBE_DEFER
issue has been solved by making the ACPI core instantiate a
platform_device instead of an i2c_client (in this case we
did not need the actual i2c_client at all).

The current i2c-core code has a (!client-irq) test guarding its
code of trying to use the first ACPI fwnode IRQ resource.

So we could disable this by setting client->irq = -ENOENT in
serial-multi-instantiate.c when (inst->flags & IRQ_RESOURCE_TYPE) ==
IRQ_RESOURCE_NONE). But that will introduce a new problem. Many
i2c-drivers check if there is an IRQ for them to use by doing:
"if (client->irq) request_irq(client->irq, ...)" but then with
error checking/so setting client->irq to -ENOENT will cause
the request_irq to fail, leading the probe to fail.

So before you can write a patch setting client->irq = -ENOENT
when (inst->flags & IRQ_RESOURCE_TYPE) == IRQ_RESOURCE_NONE),
you would first need to patch all i2c-drivers for clients
instantiated through serial-multi-instantiate.c changing:

	if (client->irq) {
		...
	}

to:

	if (client->irq > 0) {
		...
	}

Note this is not as bad as it sounds, since there are only
a few drivers for clients instantiated by serial-multi-instantiate.c .


3. Some drivers may check for an ACPI companion device and then
change their behavior. So all drivers for clients instantiated
through serial-multi-instantiate.c will need to be audited for
this (and a summary of this audit needs to be added to the commit
msg).

Regards,

Hans
