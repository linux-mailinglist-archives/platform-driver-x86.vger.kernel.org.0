But as it stands it is more consistent with what happens elsewhere in this =

The return value of 0 means that the list is empty, so there's nothing to f=

I don't see a problem here though.

I had considered using it, but then I couldn't convince myself that it
would matter, so I went for simpler code.

You seem to be arguing that it matters after all, so why does it matter?
