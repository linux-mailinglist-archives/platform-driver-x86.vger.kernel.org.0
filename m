No, it doesn't.

It expects the platform_profile file to be available on startup, at
worse with the choices not yet filled in. It doesn't handle the
platform_profile file going away, it doesn't handle the
platform_profile_choices file changing after it's been initially
filled in, and it doesn't support less than one power profile being
made available, and only supports hiding the performance profile if
the platform doesn't support it.

Some of those things we could change/fix, some other things will not.
If the platform_profile_choices file only contained a single item,
then power-profiles-daemon would just export the "low-power" and
"balanced" profiles to user-space, as it does on unsupported hardware.

The profiles in power-profiles-daemon are supposed to show the user
intent, which having a single setting would effectively nullify.
It's unclear to me how CnQF takes user intent into account (it's also
unclear to me how that's a low-power setting rather than a combination
of the existing cool and quiet settings).
