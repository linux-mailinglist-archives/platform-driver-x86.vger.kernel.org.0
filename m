One can always print them before clearing for debug purposes.

Sorry, seems slipped in cracks. I have checked the doc, below is the citation.

5.6.4
 Wake Source Indicators
 The PMIC contains one register which is intended to store the cause of a wake event,
 so that software can determine why the system was woken from Cold Off. These bits
 are write-1-to-clear.
 If the WAKESRC register is not cleared by the SOC, stale bits (from past wakes) will
 auto-clear. This is to ensure that only the most recent wake reason is flagged for SW

 Table 5-51: Wake Source Register
 Register Name R/W D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 Initial Address
 WAKESRC R RSVD WAKE WAKU WAKE WAKE 0X00 TBD
		ADPT SB BAT PBTN
 BIT NAME FUNCTION DEFAULT
 D[7:4]	  Reserved
 		  Reserved
 0
 D[3]	  WAKEADPT
 		  0 = No wake by an AC/DC adapter insertion
 		  1 = Wake was triggered by an AC/DC adapter
 		  insertion.
 0
 D[2]	  WAKEUSB
 		  0 = No wake by a USB charger insertion
 		  1 = Wake was triggered by a USB charger insertion.
 0
 D[1]	  WAKEBAT
 		  0 = No wake by a battery insertion
 		  1 = Wake was triggered by a battery insertion.
 0
 D[0]	  WAKEPBTN
 		  0 = No wake by user pressing the power button
 		  1 = Wake was triggered by user pressing the power
 		  button.
