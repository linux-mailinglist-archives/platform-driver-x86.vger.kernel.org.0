In the flash case the v4l2 framework disables the sysfs interface for the LED whilst it holds the flash subdev open, which should mean that no nefarious program could turn off the LED whilst it was running the camera but because the sysfs is enabled whilst the v4l2 subdev is closed [1] you could still use that LED as a torch outside of camera streaming. That's probably not a situation that's likely to occur with a privacy LED given they're likely to be much less bright though I suppose, and maybe it's right to treat them differently.

If we only disable the sysfs access temporarily then spy-ware in userspace
can still just clear the trigger, so we would need to permanently
disable userspace access (or decide to not disable userspace access
at all).

Which would involve a bunch of non trivial code. Where as if we
just model the LED as a GPIO for the sensor-driver to consume
we get this for free.

My conclusion here is:

1. We don't want userspace access because we don't want to make things
easier for spy-ware.

2. Without userspace access there is no added value in using the LED
subsystem and just modelling this as a GPIO is easier / more KISS.

I glad you like the idea. Any suggestions for a better name
for the helper lib / namespace ?
