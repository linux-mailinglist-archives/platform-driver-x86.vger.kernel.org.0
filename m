See below for a question about charge_type_store() if we get rid of

Here we're using DELL_BAT_MODE_MAX to determine if we failed to match
any mode strings sent from the user. If we get rid of that, we're either
going to have to use a separate variable (eg, 'bool matched =3D false;' and
set it to true in case of a match), or iterate backwards (eg,
for (mode =3D ARRAY_SIZE(battery_state); mode >=3D DELL_BAT_MODE_NONE; mode=
--) {
	...
}
if (mode !=3D DELL_BAT_MODE_NONE) {
	ret =3D battery_charging_mode_set(mode);


Do you have a preference?

I checked this. The BIOS sets the mode value in every related token
location. I'm still not really sure what libsmbios is doing, but the
kernel code seems to arbitrarily choose one of the token locations
to read from. This makes sense to me now.

In the BIOS when I set the mode to "ExpressCharge",
this what I pulled for each token location:

[    5.704651] dell-laptop dell-laptop: BAT_CUSTOM_MODE_TOKEN value: 2
[    5.707015] dell-laptop dell-laptop: BAT_PRI_AC_MODE_TOKEN value: 2
[    5.709114] dell-laptop dell-laptop: BAT_ADAPTIVE_MODE_TOKEN value: 2
[    5.711041] dell-laptop dell-laptop: BAT_STANDARD_MODE_TOKEN value: 2
[    5.713705] dell-laptop dell-laptop: BAT_EXPRESS_MODE_TOKEN value: 2

Similar story when I set it to Custom (all were '5'), or Standard ('1').
When I set it from linux as well, it changed all location values.

I agree, but I'm not seeing a way to do that right now given how the
BIOS sets the mode. Maybe libsmbios has some clues...
