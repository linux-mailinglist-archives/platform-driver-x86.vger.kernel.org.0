i have an Intel NUC6i7KYB on my LAN that i use for dev running Clear
Linux 6.0.2-1201.native on Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6770HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz.

i can't pinpoint exactly when but sometime in the last 2 months the
fan, normally silent, after a certain amount of idle time post boot,
the fan suddenly goes wild and then does not stop until the device is
rebooted.

i finally decided to look into this the other day and saw that the
only temp critical component is the PECI Agent 0 as seen below, and
then saw that support for this component was added in Linux 5.18.

so there must be a bug somewhere. let me know what data i can gather
or what other information you need to help solve this.
