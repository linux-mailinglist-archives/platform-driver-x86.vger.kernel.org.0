That's the problem: we have _multiple_ motherboards with _multiple_ differe=
nt
chipsets from _different_ vendors=20

1) all having the same glitch
2) all requiring the same workaround
3) working just fine under Windows with no hacks

And at the same time you're talking about asus_wmi which covers only _certa=
in_
ASUS motherboards, and no one in this discussion has shown it to work or
provide the same set of sensors.

And this driver has nothing to do with sensors,
linux/drivers/platform/x86/asus-wmi.c:

 * Asus PC WMI hotkey driver

This is not a driver which even tangentially deals with HW sensors found in
motherboards affected by this bug.

I don't know why you're trying to sweep this bug under the rug but I really
dislike it. The Linux kernel development has always followed common sense
principles and it contains a _huge_ number of workarounds just to enable HW
which doesn't work according to specs.

At the very least you could printk() this:

"Your motherboard might not exposing ACPI resources correctly, so you might=
 not
get access to your HW sensors. You could add "acpi_enforce_resources=3Dlax"=
 to
kernel boot parameters to enable monitoring at your own risk. Please refer =
to
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3D204807 for more information".

And this still paints Linux in a very bad light as users hardly care about =
if
ACPI is implemented according to the specifications or not: however what th=
ey
really care is whether their hardware works or being supported under Linux
regardless out of the box. Most Linux users don't even know `dmesg` exists,=
 so
they have no way of knowing how to fix the issue.

Lastly, this bug is not fixed.
