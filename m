Yes, I did another double check to be sure, with different non zero values, here each byte is clearly setting its own fan speed, they're independent from each other.
So the writing you suggest is more appropriate, resetting both fans to automatic speed, needs the zero value (HP_FAN_SPEED_AUTOMATIC) to be set into both bytes.

Fine :-) Thanks for the explanations, no problem I completely understand.
So I looked around for occurrences of the same things to fix into others already existing functions, and I carefully applied the change where appropriate.

Good to know!
Prepared the v3 for the next round (tested it and checked with scripts/checkpatch.pl as always), and described the changes; I'm sending it now.
