That's a link to a series "[PATCH v5 0/6] Introduce intel_skl_int3472
module" which doesn't have any explanatory text as to what it's doing in
the cover letter (just an inter version changelog) nor any obvious
relevance to this series, are you sure that's the right link?  In
general it's best if your patch series contains enough explanatory
information to allow someone to have a reasonable idea what the series
does without having to follow links like this.

What is a software node and why would we want to use one here?

So these systems lack an enumerable description of the system provided
by hardware or firmware (or given that these are ACPI systems I guess
the firmware description is just broken) so we need to use board files.
Why are we not just using board files, what does this new abstraction
solve?

I don't think I understand what the problem you are trying to solve is
so it's hard to say if this is a good approach to solving it.
