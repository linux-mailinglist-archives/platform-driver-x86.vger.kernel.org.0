As I understand it the problem before was that the function would
return -ETIMEDOUT; purely based on wait_for_completion_timeout()
without ever actually checking the BUSY bit:

Old code:

	if (!wait_for_completion_timeout(&scu->cmd_complete, IPC_TIMEOUT))
		return -ETIMEDOUT;

This allows for a scenario where when the IRQ processing got delayed
(on say another core) causing the timeout to trigger,
ipc_wait_for_interrupt() would return -ETIMEDOUT even though
the BUSY flag was already cleared by the SCU.

This patch adds an explicit check for the BUSY flag after
the wait_for_completion(), rather then relying on the
wait_for_completion() return value which implies things
are still busy.

As for "What prevents IPC_STATUS_BUSY from 
changing right after you've read it in ipc_read_status(scu)?"

AFAICT in this code path the bit is only ever supposed to go
from being set (busy) to unset (not busy), not the other
way around since no new commands can be submitted until
this function has completed. So that scenario cannot happen.

Regards,

Hans
