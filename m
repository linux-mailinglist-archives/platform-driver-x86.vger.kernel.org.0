No problem.  Thanks for looking.  I'll get a new version ready to put 
out after the next merge window.

Some of the series was pared down to go in multiple parts to make it 
easier to review with follow ups for the dynamic stuff planned for the 
next iteration.

You see some artifacts of that comments and Kconfig.  I figured it was 
better to leave as is for those given they get to the intent, but I can 
change if you think it's better to adjust them when the next part lands 
instead.
