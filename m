--- Comment #31 from Hans de Goede (jwrdegoede@fedoraproject.org) ---
(In reply to Richard Neumann from comment #30)

Ok, so that translates to:

options amd_sfh_hid sensor_mask=0x80007

So you are enabling all 4 sensors:

#define ACEL_EN         BIT(0)
#define GYRO_EN         BIT(1)
#define MAGNO_EN        BIT(2)
#define ALS_EN          BIT(19)

I assume that you have verified that all 4 work?

Note that you can actually use hex-values (prefixed with 0x) when setting
integer module parameters, that typically make things easier to parse in cases
where the integer is a bitmask like this case.

May I ask you to at least consider re-posting the series as is with the email
going to the right people:

[hans@x1 linux]$ scripts/get_maintainer.pl -f
drivers/hid/amd-sfh-hid/amd_sfh_pcie.c
Nehal Shah <nehal-bakulchandra.shah@amd.com> (maintainer:AMD SENSOR FUSION HUB
DRIVER)
Sandeep Singh <sandeep.singh@amd.com> (maintainer:AMD SENSOR FUSION HUB DRIVER)
Jiri Kosina <jikos@kernel.org> (maintainer:HID CORE LAYER)
Benjamin Tissoires <benjamin.tissoires@redhat.com> (maintainer:HID CORE LAYER)
linux-input@vger.kernel.org (open list:AMD SENSOR FUSION HUB DRIVER)

With a cover letter why you believe that your version is better / cleaner ?

Note you will very probably still be asked to refactor your work so that it
will consist of incremental patches which slowly moves the existing driver to
your version. But this way at least the maintainers will be aware that there is
room for improvement, because I'm pretty sure that they will not have seen the
posting to the linux-iio list.
