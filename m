Hmm, can you elaborate a bit on this?  Does ACPI somehow expose the LEDs / GPIO to userspace
already and will adding APU5 / APU6 support make those ACPI exposed devices go away ?

If yes then what is the advantage of using the APU driver over the ACPI exported functionality?

Sorry for being a bit pedantic about this patch, but as a maintainer it is my responsibility
to ensure that we don't break existing userspace, e.g. existing use-cases using the exposed
ACPI devices.

Note "fixing" this might be as simple as putting the new APU5 / APU6 support behind an extra Kconfig
option (behind a modparam actually with a Kconfig option to select the default of the modparam).

This way we can get distro's to opt-in to (or opt-out depending on the default) the new behavior,
needing a modparam + Kconfig option for this is not ideal, but if there is a significant behavior
change it is an escape hatch we can use.

Yes I vaguely remember back then I was hoping / expecting you and Enrico to sort things
out, but that seems to have not happened. And given Enrico's silence in this thread
I'm not sure if Enrico is still working on this. So I guess now I get to figure out how
to move forward here.

I agree that we need to find a way forward here. I would like to get this resolved
and to get something merged into the mainline kernel for this.

I also agree that if there is breakage it would be best to just break things only once.

If there is going to breakage though I think we need some toggle to toggle between
the old and new *mainline* kernel behavior. This could be as easy as making the modparam
for this just abort probe() (return -ENODEV) on the new APU models when it is set to its
"backward compat" value.

Yes my original compatibility remark was just about reordering some definitions +
keeping the old labels for the already supported APU models.

So talking in code my proposal is to change this (in the new code):

#define APU2_GPIO_LINE_LED1		0
#define APU2_GPIO_LINE_LED2		1
#define APU2_GPIO_LINE_LED3		2
#define APU2_GPIO_LINE_MODESW		3
#define APU2_GPIO_LINE_RESETM1		4
#define APU2_GPIO_LINE_RESETM2		5
#define APU2_GPIO_LINE_SIMSWAP		6

to:

#define APU2_GPIO_LINE_LED1		0
#define APU2_GPIO_LINE_LED2		1
#define APU2_GPIO_LINE_LED3		2
#define APU2_GPIO_LINE_MODESW		3
#define APU2_GPIO_LINE_SIMSWAP		4
#define APU2_GPIO_LINE_RESETM1		5
#define APU2_GPIO_LINE_RESETM2		6

Keeping the simswap signal as GPIO/pin number 4 instead of moving it
to the end.

And also instead of making changes to apu2_gpio_names[] (1)
introduce a new apu5_gpio_names[] / apu6_gpio_names[] so that
the labels don't change on the existing supported models.

I'm less worried about the label change then about the index
change, because typical GPIO use from userspace will use
indexes not labels. So if having different labels on
different APU versions is a big problem you might be able to
convince me to change the labels on the old models too.

Summarizing:

Please change:

1. The GPIO indexing to keep simswap at its old place
2. Use the labels only on new models (open for discussion).

Open questions:
1. Can you elaborate a bit about the ACPI way of accessing these
things. If that is actually a thing, we cannot just break it
(but we could use a module-parameter for still breaking it).

2. You mention this is important to the openwrt community are
there already openwrt people in the Cc here so that we can get
their input? If not can you reach out to them ?

Regards,

Hans
