You can check the events by running something like:

  dbus-monitor --system "type=3D'signal',interface=3D'org.freedesktop.UPowe=
r.KbdBacklight',member=3D'BrightnessChanged'"

The gnome-settings-daemon watches these signals and instructs the GNOME she=
ll to display
an OSD about the new keyboard brightness. Well, at least on my machine. A q=
uick search in
the repository[1] suggests that KDE's PowerDevil is also listening for thes=
e signals.

I am not sure now, but I seem to recall that UPower needed to be restarted =
to see a LED
that appeared after it was started when I was testing these LED brightness =
change notifications.
