As Hans already said, it is a no go to put drivers tagged as
_(DANGEROUS)_ within the kernel distro. In this thread [1] from the
latest changes to the intel-spi driver I asked if there is any reason
to keep the dangerous tag or if there is any work we can do to achieve
this. As long as this tag is in the driver, we can't use the driver.
