HP EliteBook 845 G8: dmidecode and lshw

No external devices connected.


I'm currently *experimenting* with additional stuff.

This kernel command line options: pcie_aspm=3Dforce iommu=3Dpt
(looks like iommu=3Dpt may already be the default, but I guess adding it sh=
ould
have no disadvantage)

And also setting sysfs options before entering s2idle.
  powersupersave > /sys/module/pcie_aspm/parameters/policy
  find /sys/devices/ -type f -name wakeup -exec bash -c 'echo disabled > "{=
}"'
\;

I guess you'll need dmidecode or lshw for that. So I attached it.


Here you can see which BIOS versions contain which AMD SMU Firmware version.

-g8-notebook-pc/38492638/model/2100000127/swItemId/ob-294554-1?sku=3D5Z621EA
BIOS:
  01.10.00 Rev.A
  01.09.10 Rev.A
  01.09.00 Rev.A
SMU Firmware: 64.61.0

BIOS:
  01.08.20 Rev.A
  01.08.03 Rev.A
SMU Firmware: 64.60.0

BIOS:
  01.07.01 Rev.A
SMU Firmware: 64.48.0

Do you have internal information if all these SMU Firmware versions are
affected by the bug? If yes, I'd say the quirk can be enabled for all of th=

I'm wondering if there could be a way to dynamically detect broken EC GPE's.
And such an GPE apears, automatically set
  /sys/module/acpi/parameters/ec_no_wakeup =3D Y
Not for myself, but for other users affected by this bug.

Because it seems that not just the EliteBook 845 G8 is affected by this. (s=
ee
above for the ThinkPad Carbon X1 6th)
So an automatic detection may spare a lot of future work.


I already thought about doing this in userspace.
Systemd service:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
[Unit]
After=3Dsuspend.target hybrid-sleep.target suspend-then-hibernate.target
[Install]
WantedBy=3Dsuspend.target hybrid-sleep.target suspend-then-hibernate.target
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
And the service could call a script, which checks if there are two IRQs in =
the
dmesg like this:
  [   90.048438] PM: Triggering wakeup from IRQ 9
  [   90.048801] PM: Triggering wakeup from IRQ 1
And if yes, ec_no_wakeup=3DY is being set. Or at least there's a message te=
lling
the user to enable ec_no_wakeup=3DY.
If this would be in the kernel, that message could appear in dmesg.

But I'd guess a general detection wouldn't be that simple!?...
