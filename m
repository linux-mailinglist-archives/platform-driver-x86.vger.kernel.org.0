No need for a v2.

It does and I understand your point of view here.

Right, but you suggested resending it as a non RFC, and then there is some
cross tree coordination which needs to happen to merge it; and since
this series is just cleanups with no functional changes I would prefer to
delay this one a bit to make the cross tree coordination simpler
(iow keeps i2c-multi-instatiate.c unmodified from rc1 for now).

I hope this explains why I'm delaying your cleanups a bit.

As I tried to explain in my reaction to the RFC cover-letter I'm not sure we
should apply those patches right now as there is no immediate need for
passing the fwnode and a non 0 chance of regressions. But lets discuss that
in that thread. If we decide to not apply that series for now then I'll apply
this series (minus patch 3) right away.

Regards,

Hans
