Yes that is correct. The current patches theoretically (untested) is good
to go. The only thing which still needs to happen is test it.

Yes I hope to be able to test this the x86-android-tablets series this
week (likely in the weekend). Once that has been tested I think we can
assume that the 3 independent patches will also work and merge all of
them.
