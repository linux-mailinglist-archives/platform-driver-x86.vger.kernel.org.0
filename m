Thanks! I can see from your earlier email in the other thread that
this is right. Strangely, when I tested 0xAB had almost exactly the
same behavior as 0x01. I think you're right though, I have updated my
local copy to 0x01.

I have also fixed the missing cleanup calls and

After reading many times, I believe I understand this and can figure
out the implementation. How should I attribute the commits? Should
this be a 3rd patch in a v2 patch series with myself as the author? Or
should these drivers be introduced in one commit without the
intermediate single driver that uses the deprecated API?

Also have I correctly set Gergo as the commit author for this PATCH
2/2 email like Hans said to? I wasn't sure if I had it right and I
could fix it in the v2 series.

Thanks! Not sure why I thought it was okay to delete lenovo_ymc_remove
but I have added that back in with the input_unregister_device call.

I'm not following how to implement this, not familiar enough with WMI.
Could you explain more?

Is there an easy way to test if it's fine to run multiple copies?
Currently testing by compiling the module with an inlined
ideapad-laptop.h out of the kernel tree and using the insmod command
to load it.
