Yes the notifier setup is somewhat involved. I believe posting

Assuming that with "this driver" you mean the Yoga Tablet Mode switch
driver you are working on that already is a WMI BUS driver since
it is a wmi_driver which attached itself to a wmi_device.

The old way of doing things was with drivers which instantiated
their own platform_device-s and then attached to those. These
used the old specify a WMI object to operate on through GUID only
methods like wmi_evaluate_method() everywhere.
