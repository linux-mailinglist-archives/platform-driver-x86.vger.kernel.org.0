Right, so I've taken a look at that and I believe that
we need to change 2 things:

1. In drivers/platform/x86/intel/Makefile, use:

obj-$(CONFIG_INTEL_SCU_IPC)		+= scu/

Instead of:

obj-$(CONFIG_INTEL_SCU)			+= scu/

Since "config MFD_INTEL_PMC_BXT" from drivers/mfd/Kconfig
selects INTEL_SCU_IPC not INTEL_SCU. From a pdx86 pov thos
makes on difference since CONFIG_INTEL_SCU selects
INTEL_SCU_IPC too, so all pdx86 Kconfig options needing us to
dive into the scu subdir also end up selecting INTEL_SCU_IPC
(through INTEL_SC).

2. The "select INTEL_SCU_IPC" done by CONFIG_MFD_INTEL_PMC_BXT
only works if make will actually dive into the
drivers/platform/x86/intel subdir which requires
CONFIG_X86_PLATFORM_DRIVERS_INTEL to be set, so in the
"config MFD_INTEL_PMC_BXT" section of drivers/mfd/Kconfig

The following change should be made:

-	depends on X86_PLATFORM_DEVICES
+	depends on X86_PLATFORM_DRIVERS_INTEL

To ensure that we dive into the intel subdir of
drivers/platform/x86, note that X86_PLATFORM_DRIVERS_INTEL
depends on X86_PLATFORM_DEVICES (through being part of a
"if X86_PLATFORM_DEVICES" Kconfig section), so we can just
replace the depends on, rather then adding a new one.

With those 2 things changed that error should be gone.

This requires an ack from Lee to merge the drivers/mfd/Kconfig
change through pdx86, so as discussed I agree that it is best
to delay moving the scu bits till after 5.15-rc1 is out.

Great, thank you.
