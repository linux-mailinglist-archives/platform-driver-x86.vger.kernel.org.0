Hmm, is that document consistent in shortening "command" to "cmmd"? It=20
feel quite untypical and might be a typo in that document too.

If it looks inconsistent in that document, my suggestion is to use=20
cmd_base and add a comment where you define ring_info's struct to map it=20
into the RING_CMMD_BASE_0 spelling in the document.

Unfortunately, this didn't answer my question. Can those bits be asserted=
=20
at the same time? If they can, is it okay to count the failure into just a=
=20
one of the failure counters?

Please downgrade it into dev_warn() then.

Things like this might be nice to mention also into changelog so that it=20
is permanently recorded somewhere. At least to me, the fallback doesn't=20
look obvious from the code alone and one day it might be that neither of=20
us is around to tell it when a 3rd person comes and has to figure this=20
code out. :-)

I think you might have misunderstood this comment. I didn't mean to=20
address my code style and kernel API comments in separate patches, those=20
should be used right when new code is introduced.

It would be large benefit if this single big change could be split into=20
multiple patches so that you introduce this support in multiple steps.
As noted above, one potential thing would be to add the types in different=
=20
changes (if possible). If there are features which can be separated into=20
own patches, that would also help to bring the lines added per patch down=
=20
helping to review each patch, and allow writing more focused changelog=20
entry for each change, etc.

Please do realize that by posting a large patch like this, you'll place=20
this patch into a very disadvantaged position. Small patches are easy to=20
review quickly, whereas large one like this take considerable time, so the=
=20
chance for me or other reviewers finding time to go through it are much=20
lower than if the series consists smaller patches.
