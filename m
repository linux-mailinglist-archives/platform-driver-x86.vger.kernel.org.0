Ok. So it means that the filtering based on the primary battery in
add_battery callback is needed.

Dell has released documentation of some other API, see the end of this file
https://github.com/dell/libsmbios/blob/master/src/bin/smbios-battery-ctl

That is questionable. Some kernel drivers were written from reverse
engineered data in past.

Note that in some countries is reverse engineering legal if it is done
for interoperability purposes (which this one could match).

Try to send an off-list/private email to Dell.Client.Kernel@dell.com
with details for what you are asking. Maybe they would have access to
some new documentation.
