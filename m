Unfortunately, your code here does not prevent that at all, so your
moving off of a binary sysfs attribute changed nothing.

You can "prevent" this from happening just as easily through a sysfs
attribute as you can a character device node.

How am I or anyone else supposed to know that?  We write code and review
it for _today_, not what might be sometime in the future someday.  As
that will be dealt with when it actually happens.
