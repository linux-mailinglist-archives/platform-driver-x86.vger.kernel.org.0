I think the pci/quirks.c one sounds nicer.  I was envisioning a
one-time quirk where it'd be easy to log a note about this issue, but
I see why the suspend/resume quirk has advantages.  I don't really
like opaque magic behavior (like D3hot/D3cold not being used when
dmesg and lspci claim that PME in those states *should* work), but
maybe we can figure out some way to make that visible.
