Hi Hans,
there is no rush from my end to see this series merge. The current
asus-wmi quirk works well for the Ally, all firmwares. New firmware is
also supposed to fix powersaving with it.

Yes, that quirk is suboptimal as it adds a noticeable delay to suspend
and resume and blocks powersaving from working correctly in old
firmwares. However, as most Ally users are on custom kernels anyway,
and this patch series can be merged quite easily into them, broadly
speaking it is a non-issue if the mainline kernel has ideal behavior
on the Ally for the next few months. From user feedback, they did not
notice changing to this patch anyway, other than the powersaving
benefit ("did you change anything? my ally just uses less power now").

Next revision I will cc dri so we get feedback from there too.

Indeed, as this series shows (for other reasons).

In my use-case I'd like to be able to fire the display off
notification prior to turning off the screen or turn on the screen
after both Display Off and Sleep Entry have fired to be able to show a
dim lockscreen if the user briefly interacts with the device. I will
be doing this downstream for a limited set of prevalidated devices
though.

Therefore, before we block this behavior in a non-certain manner (as
it will be up to each gpu driver to do it), there needs to be some
documentation showing there is an issue, certain manufacturers rely on
the behavior, or that Microsoft has guaranteed that this is the case
in Windows. Even with any of the former, a blacklist quirk for those
manufacturers can be put in place in their GPU driver that blocks the
Display Off _DSM from firing and automatically calls the Display On
_DSM if the GPU wants to wake up the display.

GPU can do stuff while the screen is off: render videos, hold browser
videos in main memory, have a game in the background, etc. If by D3
you mean the whole GPU has powered off, this would be a deviation from
Windows.
