Thanks for the patch! It didn't work right away with my current 6.1.7-gentoo
kernel though, but I was able to apply it against vanilla v6.0. The sensors
from 6798D chip seem working now (at least the ones that I care about, like=
 fan
values):

I will be using this kernel for a while and will report if I notice any rel=

issues.
