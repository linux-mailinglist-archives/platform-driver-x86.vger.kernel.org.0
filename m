Thank you for your help! I thought mentioning LHK2019 and IDEA2004 might be
relevant as both platforms load Lenovo-specific drivers in Windows 10, thus=
 I
assumed that they are supposed to do the same in Linux.=20
May I ask how you were able to determine the DYTC version on my machine? I =
have
been unsuccessfully trying to figure it out myself for the last few days.
Thanks!
