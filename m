Hello Andy,

Thank you for reviewing the patch!

> Is there anything preventing us to use memremap() in such case?

I re-read the documentation for memremap a few times along with taking
a look at its code, but I think I am missing an important piece of
information. As I understand it, depending on its flags, memremap would
allow a section of RAM to be mapped for the PMC driver.

The intention with this patch is to prevent the driver from being
instantiated when the default/fallback memory address is in RAM, as
this issue occurs with a non-administrative virtual machine (domU in
Xen terminology) that does not simulate or pass-through a corresponding
PMC device.

I think that I have misunderstood your review comment though, so I
would apppreciate it if you could elaborate.

Thanks again for reviewing the patch,

Vefa
