There are also some functional improvements :-)

Yes.

First some nitpicking about the wording:
A module can only ever be loaded once at the same time.
However the driver from the module can be probed and bound multiple
times.

The extensions are hanging off the original struct power_supply.
The battery hook will be called for each battery and then it can add a
dedicated extension instance for each one.

More than one battery should work fine. Your hook gets called for each.
If you think that doesn't make sense just restrict the hook to a single
instance. For an example see drivers/power/supply/cros_charge-control.c
The same can be done for ACPI device, but I think many drivers share
this issue and don't have any handling for that.
