Hey!

Yeah, that's a pretty standard first-level support reply, but they usually =
need
to collect a minimal set of info before escalating the case to the technical
team.
It's definitely worth following their instructions so the issue doesn't get
stuck at the front line.

Make sure to give them as much detail as possible, for example:

- Confirm you're on the latest BIOS version, with default settings.
- Mention that you've also tested with a fresh OS installation, both Windows
and Linux if possible, to rule out any software involvement.
- Describe the steps to reproduce the problem clearly.
- Provide any other information they ask for, even if it seems unrelated.

Providing all this info helps them check all the boxes they need before the
report can be passed along to the BIOS or chipset engineers.

Once they have a clean, reproducible test case, they'll hopefully take it
seriously, that's exactly how ASUS is handling it.

So yeah, don't give up! Give them what they ask, and it'll maximize the cha=
nces
that Gigabyte's (or any other vendor=E2=80=99s) tech team can reproduce and=
 address it
properly.
