"The user will need to change the fan curves manually so will
definitely remember to mention it in bug reports" is a very different
thing to "the user can't change the fan curves to be nonsensical and
mean opposite things".

I can assure you that I will eventually get bug reports from "power
users" who break their setup and wonder why things don't work properly,
without ever mentioning the changes they made changes to the fan
curves, or anything else they might have changed.
