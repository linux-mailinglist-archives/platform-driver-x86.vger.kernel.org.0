Hi Hans,

Thanks for writing this patch, I've just tested it and the wrong state
issue is fixed. The switch is in the correct state after suspending no
matter the state before suspending. I've seen forums posts of people
experiencing the same issue on other models, so I'm sure it will help them
as well.

For the issue where the switch stops responding, it did happen once but
after rebooting I can't get it to happen again. It's hard to know for sure
since it happens randomly, or maybe I didn't have the patched module
actually loaded when it did occur. I'm guessing it probably should have
happened by now, but I can report back if it eventually happens again.

I really appreciate you taking the time to work on this.

Thanks,
Arnold
