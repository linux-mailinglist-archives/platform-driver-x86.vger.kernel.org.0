Do you have a pointer to these complex and buggy drivers anywhere?

If it is a "fallback", how is it going to interact on a system where the
SPI driver is loaded?

That's fine, but bind to the real platform device that describes this
hardware!  You are not doing anything like this at all here, you are
just creating a random device in the sysfs tree and instantly allowing
userspace access to raw memory.  You are not actually controlling the
platform device at all.

What "module dependencies"?  You do realize that distro kernels enable
all modules to be built. We have an "autoload only the modules that this
hardware needs" infrastructure that you need to tie into here, you are
totally ignoring it (despite it being present for almost 20 years
now...)

What do you mean "implicitly bound"?  How does this tie into the driver
model such that it will only be autoloaded, and have the driver bind to
the hardware, that it knows it can control?

That is what needs to be fixed here, you are just claiming that it can
talk to the hardware without having any check at all for this.

What resource in the system describes the hardware you wish to bind to?
Write a driver for _that_ resource, and have it be properly autoloaded
when that resource is present in the system.

You have hundreds of examples running on your system today, but as I do
not know where this hardware is described specifically, it's hard to be
able to point you to an example that works like that.

So again, what hardware signature describes the resource you wish to
bind to?
