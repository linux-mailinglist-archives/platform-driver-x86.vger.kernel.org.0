--- Comment #23 from Artem S. Tashkinov (aros@gmx.com) ---
Please disregard unless you have spare time and kindness in your heart.

------------------------------------------------------------

It has just dawned on me that I had one more request as part of this bug re=
port
and that was getting my APU to the optimized power saving mode enabled by=20

ryzenadj --power-saving

which is also impossible with Secure Boot mode on Linux.

I raised the issue of reprogramming CPU registers for Intel systems 7 years=
 ago
on LKML because I was in the exact same situation and that is I needed dire=
ct
access to be able to contain my system temperatures, now 7 years later AMD
gives me the same grim and depressing response: "You want to use Linux with
secure boot? Enjoy much higher system temps, noisier fans and reduced fan
life".

Why does "open" Linux allow so much less freedom to tune my system than the
ostensibly closed OS? Under Windows with Secure Boot I have the full freedo=
m to
use RyzenAdj, ThrottleStop, ZenTimings, RyzenTuner, AMD's own Ryzen Master
(which does exactly that BTW) and a ton of other low level utilities to tune
and monitor my system.

Please do not take this personally but sometimes I just get extremely
frustrated with using Linux (been using it for over 25 years now). I'm not
demanding to implement hypothetical Vulkan 2.0 spec, I'm not asking somethi=
ng
outlandish. I'm asking to expose a feature you've got full control over and
which probably takes 100 lines of code to implement. Is it also about "trade
secrets"? You can perfectly hide it behind scary looking module options, ca=
n't
you?

E.g. i_am_ok_with_destroying_my_system_and_setting_my_house_on_fire=3D1

Laptops users have no say in what their OEMs/vendors push on them. I cannot=
 go
and ask HP to add these options to BIOS, it's just not possible. I will be
ignored completely.

Oddly enough smaller vendors have been adding memory tuning options to
barebones based on Ryzen APUs, e.g. Minisforum UM790 Pro 7940HS Mini PC. I
guess this is not going to happen ever with the likes of Dell, HP, ASUS,
Lenovo, Samsung, etc. Maybe with MSI.
