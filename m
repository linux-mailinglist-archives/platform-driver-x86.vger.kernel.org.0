That is a good idea. I'm about to send out this as a proper patch-series
and I've added a module parameter to the version.

To me the comments are clear the code under the first comment
block starts with a "if (priv->features.ctrl_ps2_aux_port)" that
+ the comment to me makes it clear this is a workaround for
some models where the EC fails to turn off the touchpad itself.

Where as the second comment is just about which key-presses are
being reported and why. With that said suggestions / patches to
improve the comments are certainly welcome.

BTW did you ever try simply writing back the value returned from
VPCCMD_R_TOUCHPAD to VPCCMD_W_TOUCHPAD ?

Eray has been looking at what the Windows tools do and according
to Eray they always call VPCCMD_W_TOUCHPAD on touchpad toggle
events. So maybe just writing back the value is enough to actually
disable the touchpad ?

Hans
