So it is a bit tricky here. When the IRQ fires, it needs to know
whether asus-wmi will handle the keyboard brightness event so that it
falls back to emitting it.

If we want it to know for sure, it needs to access asus_wmi, so it
needs a spinlock or an IRQ friendly lock. This way, currently,
asus_hid_event will return -EBUSY if there is no led device so the
event propagates through hid.

If we say that it is good enough to know that it was compiled with
IS_REACHABLE(CONFIG_ASUS_WMI), ie the actual implementation of
asus_hid_event in asus-wmi will never return an error, then,
asus_hid_event can schedule a task to fire the event without a lock,
and that task can use a normal locking primitive.

If the task needs to be assigned to a device or have a handle,
asus_hid_listener can be provided to asus_hid_event, so that it is
owned by the calling device.

What would the appropriate locking primitive be in this case?
