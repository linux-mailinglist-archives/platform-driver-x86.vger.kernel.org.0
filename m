Alright - let me look at adding a helper to register them instead then.

Me too. I thought you were suggesting that I do that - sorry to have
misunderstood there. The problem we're trying to resolve here is kinda
exacerbated by a lot non-standard stuff within the ACPI for these
devices, so for example, on top of not having any power management AML
(which is what I'm trying to fix up here), the ACPI device can actually
represent a bunch of different things that might be a TPS68470 PMIC, a
different PMIC entirely or even not a physical PMIC at all, but rather
just a convenient dummy device to collect a bunch of GPIOs under. Which
one it is is revealed by parsing a buffer out of the device's ACPI, so
we need the ACPI enumeration to be able to use that properly.


Part of the reasons I went with addressing this with software nodes is
that we've used them to correct other deficiencies in the ACPI on the
same devices, like the references between the cameras and the image
signal processor ought to be described in _DSD packages [1], but are
again just hidden inside a buffer that we need to parse to figure out
the right way to make the connection, and then we used software nodes to
represent that. The difference there is that that's implementing
something that should have been there in the first place, whereas the
regulators wouldn't ordinarily be described in this way.

Okedokey; I'm happy to take another look at it from this angle then -
thanks for the feedback.
