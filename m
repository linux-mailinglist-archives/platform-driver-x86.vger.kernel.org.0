IIRC we already had this discussion, cool means cool-to-touch, so could be done by
e.g. extra aggressive ramping up of the fans, so this is not necessarily the same
as low-power.

Yes this is all somewhat confusing. Luckily (for us kernel folks) we have already
sorta decided to just use the profile-names from the vendors more or less as is and
leave figuring this out further to userspace.

The reason to use the enum + try to have a fixed list of choices is to try and
limit the proliferation of profile-names to keep things somewhat manageable.

But as I discussed previously with Elia (*) we really need all 3 of low-power
cool and quiet.

Hans
