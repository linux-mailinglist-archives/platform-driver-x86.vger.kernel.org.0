Try to add spaces in your replies. This is hard to follow.

Do not conflate driver with software. 0x5a (over the application
0xff310076) has traditionally been used by a driver in Windows to
control the backlight level, as it is done in this driver. 0x5d (over
the application 0xff310079) is only used by laptops with RGB by
Armoury crate. But this driver does not do RGB. No device
functionality relies on it being sent for any device I've seen. The
device remembers its Windows settings, incl. the backlight color, in
the absence of a driver.

Laptops without RGB such as the Duo series which I would like to add
support for next only have a 0x5a endpoint. But, they are sent garbage
inits for 0x5d and 0x5e currently. This should be fixed.

Moreso, it seems that Armoury crate on the Xbox Ally series uses
exclusively 0x5a commands and if you use 0x5d it ignores them (perhaps
RGB still works though). With the previous generation, commands worked
for either report id.

In [1] Derek removes the name matches

There are no other name matches concerning this driver in it.

The data flow is not changed in this series; you should go through the
patches once again if you think that. The only difference is 0x5e is
not sent, and 0x5d is not sent for newer devices.

Yes, we know their specific PIDs, so if you see the patch that adds
the 0x5d init, it is only added for those models.

d.

They are needed for the Xbox Ally series, but since this driver does
not do RGB it is out of scope.
