I just sent a patchset using SW_CAMERA_LENS_COVER

I guess the internal uvc privacy (UVC_CT_PRIVACY_CONTROL) shall NOT be
converted to evdev:
- If we do so, we cannot differentiate external gpio and internal, for
devices that have both
- There is no warranty that we will get a uvc_event when the control
changes, so we would have to constantly poll the device

Regards!
