ACK. Please do that in open public. There're still lots of things to
discuss that should be discussed in wide public, instead of comittee
behind closed doors.

Why not ? Lets collect the actual requirements and talk about some
viable solutions (I've already got a few ideas ...)

We should bring them here onboard, public discussion. And at the same
time we should make it crystally clear to them that weird adhoc hacks
won't be accepted and just give them very bad reputation and
shitstorming. Seriously, I believe we should go that route, in order
to prevent even more damage by insane firmware interfaces.

Such stuff really doesn't belong into firmware, at least not the way its
done now. Instead there just should be a clear description of the actual
hardware.

actually, I don't think it should go through userland (except perhaps
a knob for switching it on/off).

I don't think that this should serve as an excuse for slappy and vendor 
specific solutions, especially when userland is involved.

And if we really do that, then just as some intermediate solution,
and lets put it under staging.
