I2C at a minimum is a big part if it. So far all this "driver" dies
is instantiate I2C devices, so building it in a kernel which has I2C
disabled does not make any sense.

Yes and no, it looks similar, but there the "enum" is used to select
which ACPI resource to lookup. Where as here we are manually looking
up the interrupt number ourselves since there are no ACPI resources.

So the similarity is superficial only the actual code is quite
different.

irq_type is set to our own unique defines from above, so I'm
afraid there is no pre-defined structure matching this.

I actually started with a 1 special driver per model as concept,
but having a lot of tiny modules has a price too, figuring out Kconfig
options takes quite some time for distro kernel maintainers.

And each module adds overhead to, in disk use, but also in depmod info.

So I deliberately decided to go for one file. I'm actually not expecting
this to grow that much at all. Most tablets are dual-boot and the dual-boot
ones typically have a DSDT which is fine.

The only troublesome models which I'm aware of and which I plan to
eventually add are:

1. Asus MeMO Pad 7ME176C (7" BYT Android only tablet)
2. Asus Transformer TF103C (10" BYT Android only tablet)
3. No-name (sometimes branded as Glavey) TM800A550L (8" BYT Android only tablet)

Which puts the total at 5 devices, at least for now. So I believe that
keeping this in 1 file is fine. We can always split it later if it
becomes too big.

That expects ACPI resources, both for the I2C adapter / client address
pair (an I2cSerialBusV2 resource) as well as for the IRQs.

Maybe something for a separate cleanup series, I don't know adding
NULL checks to register/add functions is not really standard practice
in the kernel.
