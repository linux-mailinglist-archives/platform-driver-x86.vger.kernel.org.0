I would rather have the auth-mechanism-type in a separate mechanism sysfs-file
which could then contain e.g. "password" or "hotp".

But that does not solve the bit which I'm worried about,
what I'm worried about is a future scenario where there are multiple
auth mechanisms for the Admin role, and assuming we use one dir per
auth-mechanism then we would need 2 Admin sub-dirs which is not
allowed of course.

I assume that that is what the symlink suggestion you did:

Is meant to address. So for now we go with just Admin and then if
the 2 auth-mechanisms for Admin at the same time scenario happens
add the "-<mechanism>" suffix to the directory name at that point.
Or I guess we could even add a ".%d" suffix for duplicates, since
the mechanism info would already be in the separate mechanism
sysfs file.  Then we can also avoid the symlink since we can just
leave out the .%d suffix when the integer for %d is 0, there is
precedence for that.

So TL;DR: yes we could put the mechanism in a sysfs file too,
in that case I would prefer to go with a separate file though,
rather then concatenating it to the role and storing it in the
role sysfs file.

If we have both the role and mechanism (hardcoded to "password"
for now) as sysfs-files in say a:

/sys/class/firmware-attributes/dell/authentication/Admin

Dir then indeed we will not need the "-password" suffix. And if
we get more then one auth-mechanism for say the "Admin" role then
we can just name the second subdir Admin.1, etc.

So compared to the current sysfs API from the v4 patch that would
mean adding the role ("admin", or "power-on") and mechanism
(always "password" for now) sysfs files and otherwise no changes.

Oh and can we rename the "is_authentication_set" sysfs file to "is_enabled"
please?  Being set is well defined for a password, but not so much for possible
other authentication-mechanisms.

Doing the conversions in kernel is not really ideal, the kernels i18n support
is very limited. But yes for utf8->ascii and utf8->utf16 we can do the conversion
in kernel.

True, but the advantage of having userspace know it needs to be ascii is
that it can provide a much more sensible error message to the user when
the user tries to use non ascii in the password.

So I think that in the non utf8 case it would still be good to have
a password_encoding file. With that said, as discussed this sysfs-file
will be optional too, so for the "Systems Management Driver over WMI for Dell
Systems" we can just leave it out and then revisit when we merge a driver
which does not support utf8 for passwords.

Ack.
