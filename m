The upstream kernel has no tie between UEFI secure boot and hibernation. 
  I think you're talking about some distro kernels that tie UEFI secure 
boot to lockdown.  Lockdown does currently prohibit hibernation.

This sounds like a workable approach for what I understand to be your 
current design; but let me suggest some other ideas.

What happens if you're running something big and the OOM comes and 
whacks the process?  Now you don't have fan control running anymore.

So I see two options to improve things.

1) You can have userspace send a "heartbeat" to kernel space.  This can 
be as simple as a timestamp of reading a sysfs file.  If userspace 
doesn't read the file in X ms then you turn off manual control.

2) You move everything to a kthread.  Userspace can read some input 
options or maybe pick a few curve settings, but leave all the important 
logic in that kthread.
