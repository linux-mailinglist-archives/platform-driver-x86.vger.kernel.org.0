The API is power_supply_register_extension().
Indeed this is not yet part of the pdx86/for-next branch, as that is
still based upon v6.13-rc1 while power_supply_register_extension() will
only be available with v6.14-rc1 (to be released next Sunday).
However we are currently in the middle of the merge window for v6.14.
So your driver won't make it into v6.14 in any case and by the time it
can be applied to pdx86/for-next that branch will be based on v6.14-rc1.

So either wait a week or merge in power-supply/for-next manually.

Or you decide that I am annoying to push you to adopt my own feature and
just go without it :-)

You could designate a special error code to mean:
"This feature is not supported, but that's fine and continue probing".

For example EOPNOTSUPP:

ret = init_foo();
if (ret == 0)
	priv->have_foo;
elif (ret != EOPNOTSUPP)
	return ret;

ret = init_bar();
...
