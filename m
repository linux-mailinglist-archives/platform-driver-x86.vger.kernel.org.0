Hi Joshua,

There are some pre-existing 'please report to' prints already.

For the different levels of information needed for production vs 
troubleshooting, I sugges you rely mostly on dynamic debugging though so 
if you need to have a deeper look, just ask the reporter to enable dyndbg 
for the driver so you don't need to have them spamming logs in normal 
situations.

There's nothing wrong with having github as bug reporting place as long 
as somebody keeps an eye on the reports, obviously. You can add a 
MAINTAINERS entry with B:.

I also suggest if you really plan to keep an eye on this driver, add 
yourself as the maintainer too as then tools would automatically add you 
to the relevant patches so you can comment/review. I can still manage the 
merging the patches into pdx86 repo and PRs to Linus so you don't need to 
worry about handling such a boring part of maintainership :-).

Yes. It would be unnecessary dead code.

That would be more Hans' domain of expertize so I suggest you ping
him with a private mail as he has decided to pay less attention on
pdx86 mailing list's posts:
  https://lore.kernel.org/platform-driver-x86/02b4c051-ea11-4fe9-876d-070d18cd84bf@redhat.com/

Try to replace as many literals with named defines, it always helps
the code reader. Especially, if you end up adding a comment to explain a 
literal, you really would want to use a named define instead and forgo the 
comment as the code explains itself.

There are some indentation/alignment/style issues, e.g., braces around 
"else" and on continuation lines.

Be silent when no error occurs (=no non-dbg level prints).

Remove any double empty lines.

Don't split print strings to multiple lines to allow easier grep.


Please do realize it's much easier to pinpoint review comments when you 
post actual patch on the list so I hope you won't shy out too far from 
that. We do appreciate contributions and try to help you out to get them 
into shape for merging.
