Sorry, didn't know though it will eventually just get skipped.

Because state 0 is the implicit low temperature -> no min speed is required

And then high states have higher min speeds. So to sync this up I would need to 
add a dummy entry in the first position of the array.

Me too, also at one point he was talking about device trees, but isn't that only 
an ARM thing? Or can you define one for x86 devices too?

I put him in the cc again

Unloading the driver will activate the auto mode again with firmware handling 
the complete fancurve.

Userspace not responding in time, or not responding at all, or intentionally 
always requesting fan speed 0 kinda all result in the conclusion -> don't trust 
userspace.

Having this in driver is the only surefire way to communicate to the 
User(-space) that this device must not be run under full load with the fans 
turned off.

Werner
