I'd like to follow up with the firmware team to make sure we've got the
correct details and implementation (kudos on the reverse engineering
though).

Nitin - you've worked with the firmware team on hotkeys, would you mind
digging into this one please to confirm. In particular if there's been a
change how do we make sure we don't impact older platforms etc.

Mark
