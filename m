Hi,

Sorry for being a bit late with replying.

Andrew, thank you for your work on this, at a quick glance it looks great.

Armin, thank you for your help / input on this.

Jumping into the discussion a bit late here, but I disagree with this, using wmi_evaluate_method() here is fine. The chances of there ever being 2 instances of the LENOVO_YMC_QUERY_GUID are very small and we can deal with that if it ever happens.

So I really so no need to make the code needlessly complicated with 2 sub-drivers which then notify each other. Let keep things KISS and keep this as is, so for the next version only change
the method_id from 0xab to 0x01.

Ack to introducing the new driver in 1 commit. Since compared to this version only the method_id is going to make change t make it makes sense to keep Gergo as author and Andrew as Co-developed-by .

Ack, reporting the initial state would be a good addition. To keep the authorship clear I think this can be added as a follow-up 3/3 patch in the next version.

I realize this contradicts a bit with my previous lets introduce the driver in 1 commit thing, but in this case I think this makes the most sense.

I'm not sure about adding this to the allowlist, using the new API is good (and nice and clean) but this is still expected to be a singleton.

Hans
