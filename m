It is a port of the closed and open tools in Windows LenovoLegionToolkit, Vantage, LegionFanControl. I am testing it on different laptops with the help of a forum/chat and its working quite good.

Thank you for reaching out. I'm currently catching up with
quite a big patch/bug backlog after being on holiday for
2 weeks. I'll get back to you on this, but please give
me some time.

If you have not heard back from me in 2 weeks, feel free
to ping me about this.

Regards,

Hans
