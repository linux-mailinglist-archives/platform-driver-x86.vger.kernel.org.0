Agreed, would of course rather fix it in firmware when it's a firmware 
problem. Sometimes, like the case for the previous patch (for 
InfinityBook Pro Gen10) it was unfortunately not possible to locate and 
solve in time. Was even briefly thought to be fixed before launch 
because issue disappeared (in that configuration).

Another curiosity, this second quirk entry (for the Stellaris Slim Gen6) 
is actually for previous generation. The issue didn't surface until a 
major kernel jump. Initially thought to be a regression, however, 
bisecting ended up in kernels where the issue happened seeming randomly 
every ~2-3 suspend/resume cycle. Therefore currently thought to be a 
system configuration dependent race condition whether issue triggers or 
not.

Firmware is what we're suspecting as well.

Small update, according to latest info, a write from Linux, on port 60, 
supposedly triggers the interrupt. However, so far I have only seen a 
keyboard reset that is done before suspend and that does not seem to be 
it.

Thanks for the ideas, any further insights are of course very welcome.
