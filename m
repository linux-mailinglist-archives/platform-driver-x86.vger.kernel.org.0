Is there any device where that is used for display powersaving?

I can see two problems with this approach: 1) it would happen in a
random point in the suspend sequence, introducing race conditions with
sensitive modern standby devices (e.g., Ally). 2) It would not be
gated and debounced properly, so a drm driver could call it 5 times
when you e.g., plug in an HDMI cable.

And indeed that is the case, that PR horribly breaks the Ally even
while any asus-wmi quirk was active. Perhaps DRM can be consulted
though, see below.

To quote Microsoft [1], "This _DSM Function will be invoked when the
operating system has entered a state where all displays=E2=80=94local and
*remote*, if any=E2=80=94have been turned off."

Since it says remote, binding it to DRM could prove difficult. In
addition, the call in Windows is made 5 seconds after the displays
turn off due to inactivity. To mirror this behavior you would need
userspace.

If there is strong indication that the Display On/Off calls interfere
with the DRM subsystem, e.g., turn off a GPU in certain laptops, the
call could be gated with a counter similar to Mario's PR and error
out. In that way, it is still controllable by userspace while ensuring
the device display is off. Is there such an indication/do we know of
such a device?

The Ally and Legion Go which I tested happily had their display turn
on after I yanked their display on and sleep exit callbacks. The
Legion Go even had its suspend light blink while the screen was on.
And both had disabled controllers. This behavior was sticky even after
a reboot. I suppose this is due to the fact that the device might
hibernate, so the EC would have to remember the last state before
power off.

I can cc on the next version.
