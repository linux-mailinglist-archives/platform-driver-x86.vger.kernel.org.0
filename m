Hi Ed and Hans,

First off, sorry for taking a while to get back.  My wife has been busy with final exams at uni and I've been having to take care of the kids for both of us.

Yes, eth0 on the APU6 is an i210 w/ SFP cage, and i211 on all of the other ports.  The APU4 and others all used i211's on all the ports (for 1000baseTX).

I've asked PC Engines for a definitive list of what GPIO lines are used for what on all of the current revs of the boards.  I'll share that as soon as I get it.

Other than ACPI being less than reliable in a lot of cases?

If people wanted to use ACPI instead of the APU driver, why not just build their kernels without the APU driver linked in?

I've been thinking about this the last few days, and the APU's are all low-power, headless (no video), SBC's.  They're designed for embedded usage.  That is, they don't have generic distros like Ubuntu (et al) installed on them, so the kernel and the bundled applications are all released together, typically in an monolithic image (at least that's the case for OpenWRT).

Changing the kernel and what's visible in user-space typically isn't a problem as long as both happen at the same time.  That's what we've done with OpenWRT, adding the 2 new board models, and the mapping of led triggers to GPIO lines.

What would this look like?  Would it be a boolean that throws the switch from "classic/legacy" to "updated" mapping?  I think that could work...  Since in OpenWRT we control both the drivers, the Kconfig settings, and the default GRUB parameters, that would work in our case.  I can't speak for pfSense, etc.

Paul and myself are both from the OpenWRT community.
