I received no response to the email i send to Dell.Client.Kernel@dell.com,=
 so i started reverse-engineering
the Dell software which is used to control the battery charge settings.

My findings (as for now) are:

- there exists an extended battery control interface where the charge mode=
 can be set for each individual battery
- this extended interface uses the Dell SMBIOS calling interface together =
with some extensions
- the interface has a design flaw which makes it impossible to reliably su=
pport hot-swap batteries (thanks Dell!)
- the extended interface might only be supported on WMI-capable machines, =
but i need to verify this

I will need some more time for reverse-engineering the whole interface, bu=
t i believe adding support for it should
be possible.

For now, i think this patch series is the way forward.

Armin Wolf
