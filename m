Hi,

The values are 1,2,3 - where 1 = fan curve enabled/manual, 2 = auto. 3 here is custom extra that writes default curve back then defaults to 2.

Ah, so this is a bit different then how I thought this would work
(this is probably better though).

<snip>

>>>  The fans have settings [1,2,3] under pwm<N>_enable:

>>>  2. Disable and use factory fan mode
>>>  3. Same as 2, additionally restoring default factory curve.

Quoting Documentation/hwmon/sysfs-interface.rst

`pwm[1-*]_enable`
                Fan speed control method:

                - 0: no fan speed control (i.e. fan at full speed)
                - 1: manual fan speed control enabled (using `pwm[1-*]`)
                - 2+: automatic fan speed control enabled

1 normally means the fans runs at a fixed speed, but you are using it
for the custom/manual profile, which is still a temp<->pwm table,
right?

I guess this make sense since full manual control is not supported
and this keeps "2" aka auto as being the normal factory auto
setting which is good.

Bastien is this interface usable for p-p-d ?

I guess that it is a bit annoying that you need to figure out
the # in the hwmon# part of the path, but there will be only
one hwmon child.

You could also go through /sys/class/hwmon but then you really
have no idea which one to use. Ideally we would have some way
to indicate that there is a hmwon class-dev associated with
/sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile but as we mentioned before
we should defer coming up with a generic solution for this
until we have more then 1 user, so that we hopefully get the
generic solution right in one go.

Regards,

Hans
