Splendid world, indeed. I'm wondering, however, why the incorrect state
is reported? Is it similar to the linked issue on the Manjaro forum, where =
a
different bit is seemingly used to report the tablet mode state, or somethi=
ng else?
I'm also wondering why it was chosen that a *set* bit means that the tablet
mode is *off*. All these problems could've been easily avoided... (given th=
at
I'm not missing anything obvious).
