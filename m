Harmonization with other platform driver regarding the firmware attribute =
names will
likely not result in any benefits. I am not aware of any utility profiting=
 from such
a thing.

Can you send me the acpidump of your machine (with the fan bug)? I can che=
ck how the
ACPI battery handles this case internally.
