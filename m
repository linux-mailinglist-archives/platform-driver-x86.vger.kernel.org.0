I don't have a strong opinion on this but the kernel driver is already 
knowledgeable about the quirks of what does and doesn't work on the 
system so it seems like a good place to have that logic.

What if we have an API for "configured" and "actual" - and if they 
differ userspace knows it should figure out why (likely lapmode, but if 
the HW vendor adds a new setting related to "position of sun in the sky" 
or "how much money is in your account and can you afford the electricity 
bill?" that could be added too....)
