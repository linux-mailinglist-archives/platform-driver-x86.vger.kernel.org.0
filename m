please add:


cat /sys/class/dmi/id/board_name

ROG STRIX X570-F GAMING


can confirm latest debug.diff is working, many thanks:


Now follows a summary of the probes I have just done.
Just press ENTER to continue:=20

Driver `nct6775':
  * ISA bus, address 0x290
    Chip `Nuvoton NCT6798D Super IO Sensors' (confidence: 9)

Driver `k10temp' (autoloaded):
  * Chip `AMD Family 17h thermal sensors' (confidence: 9)

Do you want to overwrite /etc/sysconfig/lm_sensors? (YES/no):=20
Unloading i2c-dev... OK
