Including the old state? AFAICT the old-state is being thrown away
from drm_atomic_helper_swap_state(), so if we do this in a different
place then we don't have access to the old-state.

But this is not a modeset, this is more like changing the backlight brightness,
atm the code does not set the needs_modeset when only the privacy-screen
sw-state has changed.

Also in my experience the firmware (AML) code which we end up calling
for this is not the highest quality code, often it has interesting
issues / unhandled corner cases. So in my experience with ACPI we
really should try to avoid these calls unless we absolutely must make them,
but I guess not making unnecessary calls is something which could be handled
inside the actual privacy-screen driver instead.

Right, but again this is not a full modeset.

It is not being poked, it is only being read, also this is happening
before swap_state.

Note I'm open for suggestions to handle this differently,
including changing the drm_connector_update_privacy_screen()
helper which currently relies on being passed the state before swap_state
is called:

void drm_connector_update_privacy_screen(struct drm_connector *connector,
					 struct drm_atomic_state *state)
{
	struct drm_connector_state *new_connector_state, *old_connector_state;
	int ret;

	if (!connector->privacy_screen)
		return;

	new_connector_state = drm_atomic_get_new_connector_state(state, connector);
	old_connector_state = drm_atomic_get_old_connector_state(state, connector);

	if (new_connector_state->privacy_screen_sw_state ==
	    old_connector_state->privacy_screen_sw_state)
		return;

	ret = drm_privacy_screen_set_sw_state(connector->privacy_screen,
				new_connector_state->privacy_screen_sw_state);
	if (ret) {
		drm_err(connector->dev, "Error updating privacy-screen sw_state\n");
		return;
	}

So if you have any suggestions how to do this differently, please let me know
and I will take a shot at implementing those suggestions.

Please keep in mind that the drm_privacy_screen_set_sw_state() call also
needs to happens when just the connector_state->privacy_screen_sw_state changes,
which is not a reason to do a full modeset (iow needs_modeset maybe 0 during
the commit)

Regards,

Hans
