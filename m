Nice! This is information which is really important and need to have it
documented.

I'm fine with this patch now.

Mario, are you able to get some official documentation for these 0x0012
event types? I think it could be really useful for community so they can
understand and add easily new type of code and events. Because currently
we are just guessing what it could be. (It is sequence? Or single event?
Or single event with extended data? It is generic event? Or it is real
keypress? etc...)
