Hi,

I have been unable to work on this for the past few weeks, first I got
sick, then I had lots of other things I was behind on because of the
sickness, then my main computer that I develop on (not the toshiba) broke,
and got a motherboard replacement (under warranty), but then the
refurbished replacement was faulty in a different way, and I'm currently
waiting for replacement of that one. Plus I now have a lot of deadlines
that I'm behind on because of that.

In summary: I have no idea when I will have time to look at the Toshiba
again. I *do* want to get back to it eventually, but don't hold your breath.

I do agree with your letter below though, once I get to that stuff. I have
added some comments.

Is that what provides the value to /sys/class/power_supply/ADP1/online ?
Because that appears to be quite fast.

I have since discovered that there seems to be another way to read these
(and some other) values that the Windows software uses sometimes, which I
*believe* to be basically a an async request and poll for completion
approach. However these calls do not appear to be that much faster when I
try them, so I'm having trouble seeing the point of it (maybe it makes more
difference on some other model?). Finally it doesn't fit the Linux HWMON
API, which is a blocking read API.

The traces basically look like:
1. Please load value -> OK
2. Is it done yet? -> No
3. Is it done yet? -> Yes, here is the value.

Though usually it is done by point 2 already.

The API itself for this is rather strange, my best guess is:

{HCI_GET, async_register_id, normal_param1, normal_param2,
 normal_register_id, flag for load/check for completion}

There are several such async register IDs (0xa1, 0xa7, 0xa8, ...), but each
async register only accepts a (sometimes overlapping) subset of normal
registers.

In summary it seems quite painful to use, for very little gain given that
the userspace API is blocking anyway. Thus I did not spend a large amount
of time on figuring out or documenting the details of this feature. I know
enough now to figure out how to do the equivilent non-async call when I see
async calls in the traces.

That seems like a good idea.
