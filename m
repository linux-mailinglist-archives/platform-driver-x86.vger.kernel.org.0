Andy,

The whole series looks good to me now.  You can put this on the patches
when they're swooped up.

Reviewed-by: Mario Limonciello <mario.limonciello@dell.com>

However I would like to note there was a comment that you had a direct ques=
tion
asked by Pali that probably got lost in the thread.  This was on patch 3/3 =
on v3.
I think it's worth answering as it could dictate a follow up patch to chang=
e behavior.

The summary of my argument which led to his is nested somewhere in the thre=
ad was that
to most users this isn't useful since they can't act on it.  IE they can't =
use something
like setkeycodes and go on their merry way.  The user who could act on it b=
y coming
to upstream and submitting questions and patches is more technical and havi=
ng them
use dyndbg to turn on the messages about unknown shouldn't be a big deal.

Can you please advise which way you would rather have the subsystem go?
