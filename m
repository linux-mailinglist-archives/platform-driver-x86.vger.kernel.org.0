My apologies. I wasn't aware that WMAA was an autogenerated method name; 
I thought it was the name of the ACPI method and that the 603E9613... 
WMI GUID happened to wrap it. Given your explanation, I agree that the 
current name is inappropriate.

I will have to check about the origin of the "API" to be certain. My 
understanding is that this WMI backlight control scheme is part of 
NVIDIA design recommendations to notebook OEMs, with multiple OEMs 
potentially implementing it (I'm aware of at least two off the top of my 
head which already have systems in the wild). Specifically, this is 
meant to address an issue in hybrid systems with switchable graphics, by 
placing control of the backlight level with the EC rather than having to 
coordinate it between the different GPUs which might happen to be 
connected to the panel at any given time. It seems appropriate to me to 
include "nvidia" in the driver name for now; it could be renamed if it 
turns out non-NVIDIA designs use it as well. I don't have any specific 
information on whether or not that would be the case.

Okay, I'll send a follow-up patch to do the renaming once I get a little 
more clarification from someone who knows more about where the interface 
came from.

I've attached the output of your bmf2mof tool. Seems it's named 
"WmiBrightnessNotify", which isn't especially helpful.
