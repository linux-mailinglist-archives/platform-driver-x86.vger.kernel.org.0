But this code path is only hit when AMT / auto mode is available and
when that is true then the static slider should never be set in the BIOS
so the whole amd_pmf_update_slider() call on AMT disable can simply
be dropped AFAICT.

> At first glance this seems plausible, but actually I think it should stay as is because CQL thermals can be set at any time (that's like a lap mode sensor event from thinkpad_acpi).  Even when AMT is turned off, you may want the CQL thermal profile set accordingly.

So the CQL code is to handle lapmode when AMT is active. But I would
expect the firmware to update the power-limits, etc. for lapmode itself
when in performance mode.

The amd_pmf_update_2_cql() function only does things when
config_store.current_mode == AUTO_PERFORMANCE (or AUTO_PERFORMANCE_ON_LAP)

And that reflects the last mode selected by the auto/AMT mode code, not
the mode actual set by thinkpad_acpi so if the last auto selected mode
was balanced and then AMT gets disabled because thinkpad_acpi switches
to performance mode, then on CQL events after the switch amd_pmf_update_2_cql()
will not do anything.

To me it seems that when AMT is off the AMD-PMF code should not touch
the power-limits, etc. at all and thus it should also always ignore
CQL events when AMT is off.

This assumes that the firmware takes care of udating the limits for
on lap / off lap when thinkpad_acpi's profile is set to performance.

If thinkpad_acpi does not do this then the AMD-PMF code should
check what mode has been selected by the thinkpad_acpi code in
amd_pmf_update_2_cql() when AMT is off.

Hans
