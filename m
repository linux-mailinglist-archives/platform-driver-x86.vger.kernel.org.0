Basically what Andy says above.

Note that Dell's client team has been on the Cc for all the versions of
this patch-set many of which were posted after the "We are working on it." email.

For completeness sake I have just send a request for a status update on
this to Prasanth and David from Dell.

In the mean time it would be good IMO to merge v11 of this patch, if we
get useful info from Dell after all we can modify the driver for this
later.

Regards,

Hans
