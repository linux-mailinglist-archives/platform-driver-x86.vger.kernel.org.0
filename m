WMI is event driven.  You plug in the adapter and the platform will
evaluate its power needs and advertise it to the OS in the event.

It's important to note this is not a fixed value.
For example if you have a dock connected the power needs might be higher.

When you have the data to populate in sysfs at init time I
would agree, but at least in this case it's not always
static data that can be queried on demand.  You would have
to wait until the first event comes around and populate
some kernel structures for the sysfs attributes to read from
at that time.

As a similar suggestion to Hans', what about letting the kernel
advertise a table of fixed printf style strings for translation?
When the dynamic data comes in the event can just be an index to one
of those strings and the data in the following bytes.  Userland
could then map the strings accordingly.

Running with this concept, it could even be an overhaul to your typical
content in dmesg to allow errors and info messages to be translatable too.
