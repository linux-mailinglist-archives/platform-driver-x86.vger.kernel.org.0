Some embedded devices have status writable and use existing status
and reset when adapter is replugged. That's why there are no extra
status already.

The second argument is a very weak one. We do not accept bad
userspace API to avoid restructuring a driver. FWIW adding
attributes that way is already racy and a bug:

http://kroah.com/log/blog/2013/06/26/how-to-create-a-sysfs-file-correctly/

The power-supply subsystem offers registering custom sysfs
files since a few kernel releases by setting up the following:

/* Run-time specific power supply configuration */
struct power_supply_config {
    ...
   	/* Device specific sysfs attributes */
	const struct attribute_group **attr_grp;
    ...
}

All drivers in drivers/power/supply/ have been converted and
the ACPI is one of the last drivers not using this.

Considering some Thinkpads have two batteries the naming and
description of this is quite bad. Only the valid values part
suggests that this is just about AC.

The first part is specific to thinkpad implementation.

I wonder if its better to put both into the same file, considering
that the only logical options are

 * 0 =3D no override (=3D charge when possible)
 * 1 =3D force idle
 * 2 =3D force discharge

I.e. forced discharge implies battery not being charged.
