Yet looking at the datasheet it is a more correct name then "enable".

GPIOs being handles as ACPI power-resources is not something which is
typically done.

This was actually done correct for the atomisp devices, clks and regulators
are power-resources there, but the GPIOs are listed as plain ACPI GPIO
resources under the sensor ACPI-fwnode. And ACPI GPIO resources do not
have a name/label only an index. So drivers which need GPIOs and want 
to work on ACPI platforms need an index -> label map, see for example:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/input/touchscreen/goodix.c#n811

note how this is handled in the driver, and is not expected to be
handled by some platform specific code.

IMHO it is not so trivial done, you are assuming a 1:1 mapping for all
laptop/tablet models this is not necessarily true. E.g. on atomisp tablets
there typically is a standard camera connector with both reset and powerdown
signals and the atomisp _DSM equivalent of the INT3472 GPIO map _DSM
typically contains both signals. But on sensors with only 1 reset pin
it is unclear which of the 2 is actually used. One model camera module
with sensor X may connect the sensor's single xshutdown pin to
the powerdown signal on the standard camera connector, while another
camera module may use the reset signal on the standard connector.

There are 2 ways to handle this:

1. Make the driver deal with the fact that there may be 2 GPIOs,
treating both as optional and driving both low/high at the same time
since only 1 will actually be used. This is somewhat ugly on the driver
side, but then fixes things for all tablets/laptops out there using
this sensor model.

2. Make this the platform glue's problem and require the platform code
to have per laptop/tablet model quirks using DMI matching meaning that
instead of things just working OOTB for models not added to the quirk
table, we now need users to report an issue and then manually fix
that for every model under the sun. Which is very much sub optimal.

See e.g.:

https://github.com/jwrdegoede/linux-sunxi/commit/e43be8f19b5913a2e4bd715e7eef88fd909a2d1d

(which I have not posted upstream yet since I don't have the mt9m114
driver working on atomisp models yet)

I foresee similar problems with the INT3472 stuff. On Andy's device
we need to map reset to enable, but maybe next time it is powerdown ?

Multiply these kinda per laptop/tablet model issues by the amount
of different sensors which there are and this becomes a big 
mess of per-sensor + per-laptop-model quirks in the int3472 code,
where as these things can typically be handled reasonable well
inside the sensor driver.

> The naming used in Devicetree bindings is an ABI, we cannot change that.

Right and Andy's patch does not try to change, nor break the ABI,
Andy's patch merely adds a fallback to look for a "reset" pin if
there is no "enable" pin which is nice and simple and clean and
really not much of a burden to carry inside the sensor driver.

Drivers outside of drivers/media/i2c have much bigger kludges to
deal with interfacing with ACPI tables.

Finding that pin actually results in the INT3472 code registering
an avdd regulator, not a GPIO lookup, in this case the "power-enable"
label is something purely internal to the INT3472 code.

This is all part of the INT3472 code already bending itself over
backwards to make things "invisible to the drivers" but IMHO we
need to draw the line somewhere.

For me the main reason for saying no to this is that it is
a per sensor thing and we already have a place to handle
per sensor things and that is in the sensor driver.

I've not seen any convincing arguments from you why this
sensor specific handling does not belong in the sensor
specific driver code.

Hans
