That's a novel approach. There are some EVENT GUID's for the gamezone
interface I'll need to incorporate to keep everything in sync. These
devices have physical buttons (Fn+Q on laptops, Legion +Y button on
handhelds) to cycle the profiles. I didn't add this previously because
we were always updating it when called. I presume that each GUID will
need a separate driver for this. Any advice or examples on how to use
this to update the pprof in GameZone would be appreciated as I've
never used .notify before.

My expected information flow will be these paths:
Physical Button press -> WMI event GUID notifier driver -> Gamezone
driver update & notify_call -> Other Mode save data to priv for lookup
when current_value is checked and return STOP .
or
platform-profile class write from sysfs -> Gamezone driver update &
notify_call ->Other Mode save data to priv for lookup when
current_value is checked and return STOP .

Thanks,
Derek
