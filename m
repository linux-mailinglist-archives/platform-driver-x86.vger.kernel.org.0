Don't forget to split per logical change (to me sounds like new code contai=
ns 3
to 5 logical pieces, hence the number of patches).

Once added, parameter may not be removed (because we don't break user space=
).
So, this parameter is not so critical and I am definitely against adding it.

The compromise would be to name after the tested board (with probably comme=
nt
in the commit message and/or the code that this is possible to have the same
for all NCT6789D chips) and when confirmed, rename as Kamil proposed.
