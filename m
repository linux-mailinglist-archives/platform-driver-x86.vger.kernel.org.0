There has once again been push-back against the concept using
plain GPIOs for the privacy LED controls rather then wrapping
this in a LED class device. This time in the related series
adding support for the privacy LED on the back of Surface Go
devices:

https://lore.kernel.org/platform-driver-x86/20221128214408.165726-1-hdegoede@redhat.com/

Given all the comments / requests to use the LED class for this
I'm going to attempt to do that, see the above thread for some
challenges which I already encountered while exploring LED class
usage for this + proposed solution for those (adding a lookup
table mechanism to the LED class code similar to the existing
GPIO lookup table support).

This will result in a partial rewrite of this series, so self
NACK for this version of the series.

Andy this also means that I will not be using your new str_high_low()
helper function. The code which could use this will likely stay
around, but given that I need to do a rewrite and then get ne
reviews, it would IMHO be better to just get your series starting with:

[PATCH v1 1/3] lib/string_helpers: Add missing header files to MAINTAINERS database

upstream independently and then later my code can be moved over
to the helper (or if the helper lands first maybe use it from
day one), either way it seems best to decouple the merging
of these 2 series from each other.

Regards,

Hans
