Hello and thank you very much for the feedback.

I reworked my changes accordingly, sorry I took some time on it.
I'm going to send a corrected [Patch v2] soon, so that the changes may be reviewed (as it's my first patch submission, your feedback is welcome).

I'm going to list the changes into the [Patch v2] description, but as remainder, you can find my answers to your feedback and suggestions below.

Ok, I did all of them, so that it looks nicer and more consistent.

Sorry, was just a mistake. I changed it to "max" not capitalized.

You're right, usage of char variable types was just copy of what I saw into existing functions; but used as unsigned numeric 8-bit values, u8 variable type is indeed more relevant.
So I changed my "char" additions to "u8" as you suggested.

I dug a little more about the observed special behavior of 0 and 0xFF values for these HP WMI queries.

It turns out 0xFF is more exactly used as "ignore / don't change" parameter for HPWMI_SET_POWER_LIMITS_QUERY (0x29).
Also, 3rd and 4th parameters for HPWMI_SET_POWER_LIMITS_QUERY turned out to be PL4, and CPU + GPU concurrent TDP, so for these 4 bytes, I've changed the buffer[4] to a struct with more clearly expressed names. In order to be consistent, I did the same work for GPU power modes.

For the named define for those values, I was about to propose the following ones:

#define HP_VICTUS_ARG_VALUE_RESTORE_DEFAULT 0x00
#define HP_VICTUS_ARG_VALUE_KEEP_UNCHANGED 0xFF

However these 2 statements wouldn't always be true and could be deceptive for other settings, as it turns out using 0 or 0x00 as arguments for others WMI queries (others than fan speed and CPU power limits settings) tends to set 0 as actual value instead of restoring default one, and same goes for 0xFF. 

So for now I just moved the comment as function level comment, as you suggested below, but in case you had something else in mind, I'm of course open to another approach.

That's right, I moved those comments as you suggested.

Yes, I was copying again another approach I saw; but I indeed asked myself the same question.
So I removed this one and made platform_profile_omen_get() called instead.


Finally, while investigating about 0x00 and 0xFF special effects, I also dug a little more about a 0x57 fixed magic 4th byte used when applying GPU power modes (0x57 is 87 in decimal). It turned out to be a GPU slowdown temperature threshold, sometimes called GPS, that didn't need to be hard coded: despite being unable to use 0x00 and 0xFF to deal with it (was applying 0°C and 255°C), I successfully added HPWMI_GET_GPU_THERMAL_MODES_QUERY and associated function, and now the current setting for this value can be retrieved prior to overwrite.
So into the [Patch v2] this is used to retrieve and reuse the current value (which is confirmed to be 87 in my case after a power cycle) instead of using an hard coded value, before overwriting GPU power modes. I believe it's better that way, in case others machines are using another value in the future.

Best regards,
Julien ROBIN
