I skipped over that part.  But I'm moving all changes to a single patch 
and I will look more closely at HPE's documents.  Heaven knows they have 
plenty of lawyers, so many it's hard to ask a simple question... like 
when does a copyright take effect.  When you change it internally, or 
when it gets published?  Sounds like you lean towards the second?

Thanks,
Mike
