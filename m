It's a personal scratch your own itch project, as I daily drive the
machine.

Maybe. I only have the T14s (apart of my older Intel/AMD ThinkPads,
which use the ACPI driver). The ACPI DSDT functions completley
abstract the lowlevel I2C interface, so in theory every ThinkPad
could have a completley different EC and still use the same ACPI
driver. So this needs to be checked per-device. Hopefully the low
level interface is similar in those, so that we don't need to spam
the kernel tree with multiple different EC drivers :)

Thanks for the offer.

I would be interested in bits around system suspend. Right now
support on X1E is limited to sending the CPU into suspend. Much of
the machine seems to be still powered. Right now the keyboard
backlight and all the status LEDs stay on and the LID + power led
does not go into the typical breathing pattern. Additionally I had
to disable wakeup capabilities for the EC interrupt, as closing the
LID generates an event and thus an interrupt, which wakes the
system. Obviousy that is undesired from user's perspective. My guess
is, that there might be some register to mask events, but I haven't
found it so far. Alternatively the EC might mask them automatically
when the system is send into suspend, which I also have not yet
figured out :) The only bit I know is, that EC register 0xE0 is
involved in modern standby.

Apart from that and (probably) unrelated to the EC: I noticed that
accessing the built-in webcam (with the X1E camera patches from
Bryan O'Donoghue) does not enable the status LED. It would be
nice if you can check how that is wired, so that it can be enabled
when a camera stream is started.

Greetings,
