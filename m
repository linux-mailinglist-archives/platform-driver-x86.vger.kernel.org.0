Sure. Already prepared a patch for the 'balanced-performance' one over at [1].
Just needs some squashing and I can send in an updated series. Do you also want
me to add the 'balanced-low-power' version? I'd have chosen 'balanced' and
'balanced-performance' in the new mapping, so there wouldn't be any driver
right now using that.

There's also already one at [1] for that just waiting to be sent :)
