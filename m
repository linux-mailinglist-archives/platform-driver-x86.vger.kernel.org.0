module param would be fine to force load CnQF if the BIOS does not
advertise it.

But I still think, having a sysfs node would still help to give an
option to the user to "opt-out" of the scenarios where he thinks that
battery can drain out if CnQF is turned on? Or in any case to turn
on/off CnQF on the fly, so that he can still switch back to the
traditional "static slider" based power optimizations.

Please let me know your thoughts on this?
