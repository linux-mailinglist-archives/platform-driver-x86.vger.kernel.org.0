I think you entirely missed my point, which is that also=20
galaxybook_probe() will fail if you return an error from this function.=20
That is, you won't have battery, backlight, etc. when the probe fails.=20
This is a bit inconsistent with the other case I mentioned above where you=
=20
get everything else but platform profiles because 0 is returned.

Also, devm_platform_profile_register() won't be called regardless of=20
whether you return errno or 0 at this point so there won't be platform=20
profile handling registered anyway so most of your discussion seems=20
irrelevant.

No need to be sorry about things like that, it happens to everyone when=20
things are moving rapidly.
