I would agree but i2cdetect/i2cget works for this bus as expected. I
remember that I met this bug at one of previous iterations, hm... As I remember
it was caused by this commit:
00500147cbd3fc51353d0d003eaa9d31c72c0d50 drivers: Introduce device lookup variants by ACPI_COMPANION device.

This needs to be investigated.

OK, -EPROBE_DEFER was unexpected here for me...
