You'd still have to validate this for each individual board unless you get
confirmation from Gigabyte that the mechanism is consistent on their boards.
Then you'd have to handle other vendors using it87 chips, and those are
just as close-lipped as Gigabyte. Ultimately it would require acpi match
tables to match the various boards and access methods. I had experimented
with this this a long time ago but gave up on it after concluding that it was
unmaintainable.

The ones I know of are, yes.

Oh, that reminds me, there is another bug. Here are my comments about that:

/*
 * On various Gigabyte AM4 boards (AB350, AX370), the second Super-IO chip
 * (IT8792E) needs to be in configuration mode before accessing the first
 * due to a bug in IT8792E which otherwise results in LPC bus access errors.
 * This needs to be done before accessing the first Super-IO chip since
 * the second chip may have been accessed prior to loading this driver.
 *
 * The problem is also reported to affect IT8795E, which is used on X299 boards
 * and has the same chip ID as IT8792E (0x8733). It also appears to affect
 * systems with IT8790E, which is used on some Z97X-Gaming boards as well as
 * Z87X-OC.
 * DMI entries for those systems will be added as they become available and
 * as the problem is confirmed to affect those boards.

I don't know. Remember, zero support from Gigabyte / ITE.
