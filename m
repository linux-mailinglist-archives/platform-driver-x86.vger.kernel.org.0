Good advice - I'll update

I hadn't included those as they call get pulled in by linux/acpi.h - so
aren't needed here. I take it best practice is to add them. I'd
deliberately stripped down the list to the bare minimu previously but
happy to reverse that if it's preferred.

Shoot - I thought I'd cleaned a bunch of these up. I'll do another pass.

OK - I'll have a look. I'm not 100% sure I understand the issues, but
hopefully it will become clearer once I play with it a bit

I know there is discussion on this in future mails, so I'll leave this

Thanks for the strchrnul trick - happy to use that

Fair enough. I'll change. I quite liked the fact I had a one-liner do
the same thing - oh well :)
