Ok bummer, so it looks like only get the one event and need to catch
that (we can use i8042_install_filter() from some driver for that) and
then when we catch it probably make some ACPI call to figure out what
is going on. I took a quick peek at the acpidump you provided, but it is
huge.  One thing which did stand out is that ssdt14.dsl (after disassembling)
has:

            Method (GHKS, 0, NotSerialized)
            {
                Debug = "GetHotkeyState-----"


            Method (SHKS, 1, Serialized)
            {
                Debug = "SetHotkeyState-----"

Which may or may not be related ... But I'm afraid I do not have
the time to investigate that avenue further.

One last thing to try (I guess) is adding the following to your kernel
commandline and see if that changes things:

acpi_backlight=video

Possible other values to try are "vendor" "native" and "none"

Hans

p.s.

I think you mentioned this before, but what was the exact model of your laptop again?
