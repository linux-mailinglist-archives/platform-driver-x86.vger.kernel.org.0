First of all let me say that I think that having some generic mechanism
which allows userspace to check if deep enough sleep-state were reached
is a good idea.  And thank you for working on this!

I wonder though if it would not be better to have some mechanism
where a list of sleep states + time spend in each time is printed ?

E.g. I know that on Intel Bay Trail and Cherry Trail devices (just an
example I'm familiar with) there are S0i0 - S0i3 and we really want
to reach S0i3 during suspend.

Sometimes on S0i1 or S0i2 is reached due to some part of the hw
not getting suspended properly.

So then we have reached "a hardware sleep state over s2idle"
but no the one we want.

OTOH I can image that if we start adding support for functionality
like standby-connect under Linux that then we may not always
reach the deepest hw sleep-state.

So I'm a bit worried that having just a single number for
last_hw_state_residency is not enough.

I think that it might be better to have a mechanism to set
a set of names for hw-states (once) and then set the residency
per state (*) after resume and have the sysfs file print
the entire list.

This list could then also always include the total suspend time,
also avoiding the need for a second sysfs file and we could also
use the same format for non s2idle suspend having it print
only the total suspend time when no hw-state names are set.

Regards,

Hans


*) Using an array, so up to MAX_HW_RESIDENCY_STATES
