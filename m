Ugh, I'm really not a fan of the backlight proxy plan here. I have
plans to clean-up the whole x86 backlight mess soon and an important part
of that is to stop registering multiple backlight interfaces for the
same panel/screen.

Where as going with this workaround requires us to have 2 active
backlight interfaces active. Also this will very likely work to
(subtly) different backlight behavior before and after the first
suspend/resume.

Is there no other way to solve this issue? Maybe we need to poke
vgaswitcheroo to set the current GPU mode even though this is
already reported as active to get things to switch to the ECs
control right away ?

I'm pretty certain that Windows is not doing this backlight proxying,
IMHO we need to figure out what causes the switch after suspend/resume
and then do that thing at boot.

Regards,

Hans
