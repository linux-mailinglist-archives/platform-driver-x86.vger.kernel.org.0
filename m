Oh man... can you link me to relevant bits? I'll stick this on my to-do 
for future. There will be more patches from me over time so this might 
be good to have done?

I believe Bastiens concern here will be that manual control can still 
be enabled and ppd won't be aware of it without a check. For example 
the user may switch profile then re-enable the fan-curve. If some 
problem arises due to manual control of fan then there is no way for 
ppd to determine if manual was enabled without actually looking.

This does mean the pwm name here is set in stone. But also means it's 
special-cased I guess. Perhaps a check for pwm<N>_enable, then check 
for the pairs of pwm<N>_auto_<xX> that come with it?

Ciao,
Luke.
