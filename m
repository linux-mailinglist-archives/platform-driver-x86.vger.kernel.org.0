--- Comment #16 from Mario Limonciello (AMD) (mario.limonciello@amd.com) ---

Eventually; yes.  But I think you need to further root cause why this is
happening in openSUSE before opening a bug asking them to change a policy or
userspace software.  Narrow down which wakeup trigger is causing the spurio=
us
events, and confirm that in Ubuntu 22.10 that wakeup trigger is disabled.

When the power consumption is at this level in your test environment, can y=

please double check with amd_pmc.dyndbg enabled matches a high percentage of
the time you were suspended?=20

Yeah let's see if that series of patches changes anything.  Like I suggeste=

the otherwise unpatched configuration you should also correlate the number =
you
get for time (in microseconds) you were in the deepest state against the am=
ount
of time you were in suspend.

s2idle should be less power consumption than S3 on AMD SoCs and also have a
much faster suspend and wakeup process.
I suspect what is happening here is that HP's EC is issuing wakeups too
frequently and causing a wasted power consumption.  Let's see the informati=
on
from my other debugging steps and proposed patch if they help.

For your request I sent up https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/504971/ =
for
discussion.  You can feel free to leave a Tested-by: comment there if that
works for you.
