I noticed the difference there. I'll keep an eye on it whenever I run into
this,

Yes, that one, at least I think this is what made s2idle usable for me.

Apologies, I'll grab a fresh dmesg when it happens again. Although I'm afra=
id
it won't be very interesting.

Okay. Would adding pinctrl_amd to initramfs be enough to rule out this
possibility?

Will do.

I'm aware but I've been using this machine with forced ASPM for about 2 yea=
rs
with no apparent issues related to that. I'll give it a go.

Thanks a lot! I'll see what I can do and let you know...
