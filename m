Can we cut the drama please?

Greg has already pointed out that you cannot blindly expose this
without tying it to a property exposed by the hardware. Andy has
pointed out that your assumption that any x86_64 based platform
exposes this region does not hold.

So maybe it is time for some 'constructivism' on your part, and simply
go and implement what the reviewers suggested, rather than keep this
pointless discussion going?
