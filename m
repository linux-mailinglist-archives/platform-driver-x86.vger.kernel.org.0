Oops, sorry, my mistake, a little misunderstanding about the scope of the expected coding style fixup.
For my 1st patch submission, then, I'll keep the focus on the new feature ;-)

While I'd be happy to submit future helpful contributions when needed, I wouldn't want to become too invasive by touching too many lines outside of ideal occasions of doing so.

Yes, let's change that.

That's right, changing that too.


Thanks again and sorry about the little v3 fixup overshoot.
Preparing the v4 for the next round, I'll send it as soon as it is ready and well checked.
