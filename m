OK, so a quirk is the way to go IMO, because starting to rely on LPI
constraints in general retroactively is almost guaranteed to regress
things this way or another.

Whatever is done, it needs to be Ryzen-specific, unless there is
evidence that other (and in particular non-AMD) platforms are
affected.

So maybe the way to go is to make the AMD PMC driver set a flag for
Root Ports on suspend or similar.

In any case, I think that it would be good to agree on the approach at
the general level before posting any new patches, because we seem to
be going back and forth here.
