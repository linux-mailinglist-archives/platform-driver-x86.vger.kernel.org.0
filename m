I think your current plan sounds good. Thomas already submitted a patch se=
ries which
provides a more abstract API for registering firmware attributes.

I partly blame the comment of device_destroy(), at first glance it looks l=
ike the
natural complement of device_create(), even if its not.

I will see if i can create a patch series to fix this.

Is this non-ultra performance mode any different than the ultra performanc=

in terms of performance gains, fan speed, etc?

PLATFORM_PROFILE_CUSTOM is meant to signal that the platform is not in a w=
ell-defined
profile state, usually due to manual tuning. So please do not use it for U=
LTRA.

Can you be sure that legacy performance modes are always placed before non=
-legacy
performance modes?

If no then i suggest that you iterate over all supported modes and if you =
encounter
a legacy performance mode you check if the associated platform profile slo=
t was already
taken by a non-legacy performance mode. If that is the case you ignore tha=
t legacy performance
mode.

If you are sure that the order is always the same then you can of course s=
implify this by
iterating forward. I will leave it to you to choose which one to implement=
, as you seem
to have more knowledge about the underlying hardware than me.
