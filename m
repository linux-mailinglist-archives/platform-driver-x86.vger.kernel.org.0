So should I just wait to make any changes until you hear back in that
thread? I'm not overly excited about changing it to use the current
charge_type API, given that the only way to get a list of modes that the
hardware supports is to try setting them all and seeing what fails.

I suppose another option is to rename it to charge_types in the dell
driver under the assumption that your proposed charge_types API (or
something like it) will be added..

I originally thought to use Long Life rather than Trickle. We discussed
it here:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pm/5cfe4c42-a003-4668-8c3a-f18fb6b7fba6@gmx.de/

Based on the existing documentation and the fact that the wilco driver
already mapped it, it was decided to stick with the existing precedent
of using Trickle.

That said, Armin at first suggested creating a new "Primarily AC" entry.
That's personally my favorite option, though I understand if we don't
have to have 50 CHARGE_TYPE entries that just slightly different
variations. :)
