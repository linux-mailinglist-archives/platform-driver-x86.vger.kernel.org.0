I appreciate this.

x86_64 starting from long time ago has more or less standard hardware
interface for BIOS chip, i.e. SPI NOR. PCH usually has a separate host
controller and we have the driver in the kernel for that (coverage of
the systems may not be 100%, but close enough). Now you are trying to
repeat something that is _already_ provided by the kernel. Correct?

Why me? As far as I got it from above the bottleneck is the distros
which do not enable the driver. So why not go and work with them?
