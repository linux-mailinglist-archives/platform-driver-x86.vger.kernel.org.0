The OLPC XO 1.75 laptop is rebooted with a command to the Embedded
Controller. The EC driver should be a module, since most people don't nee=
d
it to be compiled in.

The EC driver can't use register_restart_handler() because handlers
registered with it are executed in atomic context and the XO 1.75 reboot
dance needs to block: the reboot is initiated by poking a GPIO ofter
which we need to wait for the EC to initiate a SPI transfer and finish
it.
