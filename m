Notice the 2+ here, AFAIK the API allows defining extra
settings / custom profiles when the value is higher then 2.

So you could do:

2: automatic fan speed control with factory default profiles
   (with all the pwm1_auto_point#... attributes ro perhaps ?)
3: automatic fan speed control with custom profile

Note you could swap 2 and 3 here, not sure which order makes
the most sense.

Guenter, what do you think about the above?

This will also nicely give power-profiles-daemon a nice way
to check if a custom profile is being used, which Bastien
requested to have.

Hans

This might even give us the fan curve that was set (and looks like it will on the machine that has no thermal throttle profile, v8 patch) - I'll try this anyway and see what it looks like. This seems to be the best approach given how the G713Q works anyway.

Otherwise would it be sensible to add something like `pwm1_reset`? I don't see anything like that in the related docs though. `pwm1_reset` would be to re-read the defaults from the acpi method.
