GPDI is a variable in NVS that is filled by BIOS. That variable is being
converted on OS level to the INT1 with `INT1 =3D GNUM(GPDI)`. There are 4
(almost?) identical code snippets (one per each of I=C2=B2C controllers), s=
o you
need to see which one is in use or change all of them. This will require to
recompile complete DSDT.

I would suggest to whine at vendor and tell them that their BIOS is wrongly=
 set
the pin for TouchPad device in DSDT. It is quite likely that Windows drivers
just ignore interrupt resource for touchpad (which is a mistake in Windows
driver, but we all know that the quality there is simply awful).
