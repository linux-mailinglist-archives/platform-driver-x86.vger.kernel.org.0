The first generation had two fans and where covered by the whitelist entry for the P15 Gen 2. As the second generation has two fans, too, I made that change for completeness.

Despite Mark's answer that he will look into this, it might very well
take quite a while before something comes out of that and it would be
good to in the mean time just extend the quirk list with your
ThinkPad T15g Gen 2 addition.

So can you please let me know how you want to proceed with this
