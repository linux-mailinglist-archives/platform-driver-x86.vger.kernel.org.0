Yes, I confirm changing the custom proprietary protocol of this keyboard
to a known standard is still good to me.

I would also add that the LED list was added at the very beginning of
the submission process on previous versions. Only that particular
implementation, not touching the LED subystem was not.

And again, I re-iterate that nobody is opposed to a well defined kernel
api, which can be implemented in the HID subsystem now.

That means a little longer path for this particular device (because
proprietary->HID->wonderful kernel API), but that means that other new
devices implementing natively HID lamp array would benefit from this
work instead of having a single device with that new kernel API.

But OTOH, nobody managed to be convincing enough that a new kernel API
would be benefitial and that cross platform projects like openrgb would
jump on it ASAP.
