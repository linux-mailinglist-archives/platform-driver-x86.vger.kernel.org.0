Hmm, no comments from anyone on the potential problems of using
/sys/class/backlight for this causing potential userspace confusion
since normally /sys/class/backlight devices control the main LCD
brightness ?

Luke do you have any thoughts on this yourself ?

And can you answer this question please ?  :
