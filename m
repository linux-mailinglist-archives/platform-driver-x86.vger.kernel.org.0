Hi Derek,
I have tested this patch series on an X1 (AMD) personally. I also have
multiple people that have tested it on an F1 Pro, X1 Intel, and an X1
Mini. And I am pretty sure that at least 1 or 2 people have tested on
an older BIOS too without an ill effect.

The older F1s are a bit of a question mark. The BIOS update for those
came out around Xmas and I do not have that many users with them.
However, they act identically to the new ones when it comes to the EC
and the controller, so I do not think that is that big of an issue.
Also, no one has asked yet about it not working on those devices. And
they ask about a lot of things. Yanking charging support from those
will just hurt those users unnecessarily as they will get it later.

Eileen is from OneXPlayer and is cc'd in this series.
