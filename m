If necessary, yes. It also depends where the 79% is coming from.

On my X1 carbon gen 8, there is both a "capacity" file as well as "energy_n=
ow"
and "energy_full" files under /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0. IIRC upower pre=
fers
the "energy_now" and "energy_full" files and then calculates a % based on t=
hese
itself.

It is possible that when the system stops charging
/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/capacity actually is 80% where as the calculat=
ion
of the % from:

energy_now * 100 / energy_full

Results in 79% especially if that divide is down without rounding the resul=
t to
the nearest whole percent (by default integer division in C rounds down).

So it might be better if for the "full" because of hitting the charge thres=
hold
case the check uses /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/capacity rather then
energy_now, this will all need to be tested as this gets implemented and wi=
ll
likely need some more tweaking while the feature has just landed.

Things like the above example can all lead to things looking to be 1% or
sometimes even 2% of, so yes userspace will be expected to fuzz things a bit
here if necessary.
