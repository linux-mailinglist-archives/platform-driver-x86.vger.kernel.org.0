Hi Mark - sorry for the late reply.

I do think it can simplify driver code too; a lot of them aren't written
to parse platform data to get the init data, as they're just relying on
reading it from devicetree so in the event that we get more cases like
this, we need to modify those drivers to look for platform data too. On
the other hand, even the drivers that don't directly call
of_get_regulator_init_data() still do that lookup during the
regulator_of_get_init_data() call in regulator_register(), so the ones
that do parse platform data for init_data structs will check DT as part
of regulator_register() anyway. Imitating that seems simpler to me.


It also creates some problems to suppress the enumeration of the i2c
device via ACPI (which we'll have to do in a machine specific fashion,
because some laptops have this chip with properly configured ACPI and
thus work fine as-is) to re-enumerate it in a board file with the
platform data; the ACPI methods and buffers are used by the i2c device's
driver; there's a bunch of regrettably non-standards-compliant
information in there that we need to check to make sure we do things
properly.


I take the point about this being error-prone lacking tooling support -
happy to work on this as much as needed to alleviate your concerns if we
decide to proceed down this route.

The advantage of the GPIO lookups is there's no need to have the pointer
to the registered devices to register the lookup table; we could imitate
that, by adding entries to a list with the lookup values being device
and regulator name (with the init data as the thing that's "looked up")
and check for those during regulator_register() maybe?
