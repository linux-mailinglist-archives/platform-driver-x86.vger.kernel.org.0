If you set dev->no_d3cold on the USB controllers, they should still
be able to go to D3hot, but not D3cold, which perhaps might be sufficient.
It should prevent D3cold *and* D3hot on the Root Port above.  And if you
set that on system sleep in a quirk and clear it on resume, runtime PM
shouldn't be affected.
