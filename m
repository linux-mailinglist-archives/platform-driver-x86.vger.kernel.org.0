Since you have more remarks then I anticipated I guess it is best if I drop v4
from my review-hans branch and Mark does a v5.

Mark, you can then also just squash the addition of the MAINTAINERS
entry into v5.

As I already explained in a previous reply the password cannot
contain '\n' so this cannot happen. I did miss that this was
still there, where as new_password_store() uses strreplace()
which is not really consistent with each other...

I asked for all this to be set to NULL in my review of v2,
since there are various "goto out"s in the function and out:
calls kfree() on all 3, in v2 there was a path which would
end up calling kfree() on an uninitialized char *. IMHO just
initializing all of them up front is best here because that
guarantees that they are either still NULL, or point to
memory returned by kmalloc.

Erm, you actually suggested using strreplace() here in your previous review ...

There are 2 max_lengths, one hardcoded in the driver so we don't
need to dynamically manage memory for the password storage and one
which is actually queried from the BIOS, the BIOS max-length should
always be less then the hardcoded one in the driver (and currently
this is true for all known models).

I suggested adding the WARN_ON so that if future BIOS-es ever bump
max_length we will get a bug-report about this and then we can
bump the driver's TLMI_PWD_BUFSIZE value.

Regards,

Hans
