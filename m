Hi Hans,

I did not suggest or imply to cherry-pick.

Back when I was a kernel subsystem maintainer, I did merge Linus' master
sometimes, when there was a good reason. And this is what I implied by asking if
you'd consider updating: the referenced patch is in Linus' tree.

Also, just to be clear. I did accept the criticism in your first reply. This e-
mail seems to partially repeat the criticism, so let me do better job explicitly
addressing it.

1. I apologize for sending this patch against a wrong tree. It was my mistake.
This caused confusion. Sorry for this, and I do mean it. I do realize this
caused troubles and you wasted your time because of this.
2. I apologize for the commit message with more than 75 characters per line. I
acknowledge that I should have followed checkpatch.pl suggestion. Personally, I
do not think it is a big deal, but I do understand that it is not that difficult
to just follow checkpatch.pl suggestions.

I did not participate in kernel community much for the last 7 or so years, and
some of my knowledge/skills are rust/out-of-date. I acknowledge that too. But
basics like "won't cherry pick random patches" I do understand.

Thank you, this is appreciated.

Artem.
