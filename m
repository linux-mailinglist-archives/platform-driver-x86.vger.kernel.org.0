Okay, I will work with David on that.

I suppose, but then it is adding a file for essentially 13 lines of
code. Maybe I will just move this back to intel_pmt_telemetry.c and we
can revisit where this should go if/when we add the watcher driver.

Well with something like this I usually question if it provides any
value. The problem is I don't know enough about binary sysfs
attributes to say one way or another. If you know that the offset
provided cannot be negative I can drop it. However I haven't seen
anything that seems to say one way or another.

Ah, okay so you meant PFN_PHYS(PFN_UP(...)-pfn)

Having a file here implies there is something to read. There are
devices supported by PMT which are essentially just control only,
specifically some of the watchers. So the file would have nothing to
read/mmap. In such a case it wouldn't make sense to provide a binary
sysfs attribute as there is no data to associate with it.

I will admit I don't think we tested the case where
sysfs_create_bin_file failed.

Okay, I will just explicitly add those headers then.
