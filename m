thanks for the encouraging words.

Yes, it is completely reverse-engineered.
Essentially I stumbled upon Matthews comment at
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=204807#c37 and went from there.

There actually are reports of recent, similar mainboards with recent firmware and
similar sensor chips that do not support the temperature query.
(https://github.com/t-8ch/linux-gigabyte-wmi-driver/issues/3 and
https://github.com/t-8ch/linux-gigabyte-wmi-driver/issues/2)

Unfortunately for unknown WMI queries the firmware does not return any value.
This ends up as an ACPI integer with value 0 on the driver side.
(Which I could not yet find documentation for if that is expected)
In the current version of the driver EIO is returned for 0 values which
get translated to N/A by lm-sensors.

Would it be enough to probe all six sensors and check if all return 0?

Will do.

So far I could not find out how to query this from the firmware.
The IT8688 chip can report the state of each sensor but that is not exposed by
the firmware.
But even the state information from the IT8688 is not accurate as is.
One of the sensors that is reported as being active (directly via it87) on my
machine always reports -55°C (yes, negative).

Also "0" as mentioned above.

I am collecting reports for working motherboards at
https://github.com/t-8ch/linux-gigabyte-wmi-driver/issues/1 .

That sounds good.

Thank you for the feedback!

I have not contacted them yet, will do.

As mentioned in the initial patch submission there would be different ways to
access this information firmware:

* Directly call the underlying ACPI methods (these are present in all so far
  observed firmwares, even if not exposed via WMI).
* Directly access the ACPI IndexField representing the it87 chip.
* Directly access the it87 registers while holding the relevant locks via ACPI.

I assume all of those mechanisms have no place in a proper kernel driver but
would like to get your opinion on it.
