E.g., I'd like to have autorotation triggered via the orientation sensor, but only if the device is in tablet mode; so my autorotation handler would read that sysfs entry as the first thing. If there's no way to read the state, I have to resort to watching the state toggle and cache it for myself in userspace.

No, but you can query the switch state with the evtest util.

I was surprised that your device supports intel-vbtn, there might very well be other X1 tablet generations / models which support GTOP but not intel-vbtn...

> What might be more interesting is the potential handling different attachable devices, such as the portable dock (I guess this is the "Pico Cartridge", since it comes with another battery). For this one, I would actually expect an SW_DOCK event, and via the GTOP queries, this could be detected and distinguished from other attachment options. I assume intel-vbtn can't cover that case out-of-the-box.

Right, that would be another case where having GTOP support would be helpful.

I've the first generation ThinkPad 10 with a Bay Trail SoC. Not only does it not have intel-vbtn support, it also does not have GTOP support.

I just checked and currently thinkpad_acpi does not even load on my ThinkPad 10. It does a "HKEY" device, but with a HID of LEN0168, where as thinkpad_acpi only binds to 
LEN0068 and LEN0268. I could make thinkpad_acpi bind, but it won't do anything useful. I just checked and there is nothing useful in the whole LEN0168 HKEY device.

Hmm, I'm honestly not sure what to do here...

I guess we can always grab your patch from the archives if it turns out to be useful on another device.

And until then a dummy handler indeed is probably best.

Can you do a v2 of your original patch with:

1. A comment about SW_TABLET_MODE being handled by intel-vbtn
2. In that comment also put a link to this mailinglist discussion:
https://lore.kernel.org/platform-driver-x86/38cb8265-1e30-d547-9e12-b4ae290be737@a-kobel.de/
