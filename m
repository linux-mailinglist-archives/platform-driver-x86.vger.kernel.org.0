Is this 0x0 mode real or just a placeholder value? i.e. the device always
starts with legacy low-power?

I don't know if this has been discussed before. If it was you should
follow their advice instead.

The platform_profile module doesn't enforce selected choices when
getting the current profile. Choices are only enforced when setting it.

I suggest that galaxybook_platform_profile_get() should map all known
values to valid platform profile options. Something like:

switch() {
case GB_PERFORMANCE_MODE_SILENT:
	*profile = PLATFORM_PROFILE_LOW_POWER;
	break;
case GB_PERFORMANCE_MODE_QUIET:
	*profile = PLATFORM_PROFILE_QUIET;
	break;
case GB_PERFORMANCE_MODE_OPTIMIZED:
case GB_PERFORMANCE_MODE_OPTIMIZED_LEGACY:
	*profile = PLATFORM_PROFILE_BALANCED;
	break;
case GB_PERFORMANCE_MODE_PERFORMANCE:
case GB_PERFORMANCE_MODE_PERFORMANCE_LEGACY:
	if (ultra)
		*profile = PLATFORM_PROFILE_BALANCED_PERFORMANCE;
	else
		*profile = PLATFORM_PROFILE_PERFORMANCE;
	break;
case GB_PERFORMANCE_MODE_ULTRA:
	*profile = PLAFORM_PROFILE_PERFORMANCE;
	break;
default:
	return -ENODATA;
}

Also a quick question. Why isn't silent mapped to
PLATFORM_PROFILE_QUIET. Are there devices that support both
GB_PERFORMANCE_MODE_SILENT and GB_PERFORMANCE_MODE_QUIET? Are this modes
different in nature?

I don't think CUSTOM should be used as a placeholder value.
