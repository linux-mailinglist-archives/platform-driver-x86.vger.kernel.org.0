kernel log for hibernation with platform (Linux 6.0.11)

Hi Mario,

thank you very much for your patience!

With "platform" the system doesn't really enter hibernation. So the notebook
stays on and doesn't turn off as expected for hibernation. (power led stays=
 on)

The screen just becomes black for a few seconds. But then the system contin=
ues
normally. (not crashed, still usable, but not powered off as expected for
hibernation)


You can see that there are just 10 seconds between
  PM: hibernation: hibernation entry
and
  PM: hibernation: hibernation exit
in the
  hibernate_broken_via_platform_v6.0.9.txt
(see attachment 303251 in comment 5)
In this time the screen was black.

I've just tested 6.0.11.
Looks like both commits are already included in 6.0.11. So I didn't apply t=
hem.

Problem persists. See attached log.
