kernel log for s2idle: v6.0-rc7 with bug 216516 comment #14 patches

Mystery solved:
Guess what I'm always doing after running "systemctl start suspend.target".
Yes, I'm closing the notebook lid.

--> And closing the notebook lid is what's waking the CPU!

I did a few tests, closing the lid after random times. And "deepest state f=
or"
always matched that time.




If I don't close the lid, I also get 2 % battery usage per hour with
openSUSE-15.4 and v6.0-rc7.

I have to do at least
  echo disabled > /sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio0/power/wakeup
Else the notebook completely wakes after a random time. (e.g. 20 minutes)
I guess something like a slight mouse movement then wakes it.

With i8042 wakeup disabled I can close the lid without the notebook waking =
up
completely. I can see this, because the keyboard backlight stays dark when I
slightly look below the lid. And also programs don't start running again and
dmesg also agrees.
But it looks like nevertheless the CPU is waking from the "deepest state".




About my usage behavior:
I don't like my notebook to suspend automatically when closing the lid. So I
always disable the lid close action in my desktop environment.
As a result, I always trigger s2ram manually and close the lid afterwards.




About the Ubuntu-22.10 beta and the "echo disabled" wakeup tests:
--> Forget about these!
I didn't closed the lid when testing Ubuntu-22.10 beta. And I just checked,
that Ubuntu-22.10 beta also completely wakes when closing the lid, unless i=
8042
wakeup is disabled.
And I couldn't reproduce the good consumption values after running
  find /sys/devices/ -type f -name wakeup -exec bash -c 'echo disabled > "{=
}"'
\;
when closing the lid. (see comment 15)
I probably just didn't closed the lid when doing that test for comment 15.

I did this and applied the mentioned patches. (4 commits + usleep_range pat=
ch)
Find the result in the attached log.
I closed the lod 22 seconds after s2idle started. Which matches exactly the
dmesg output:

  Last suspend in deepest state for 22133270us




OBJECTIVES:

1. Stay in deepest sleep state when closing the lid. (or immediately return=
 to
deepest sleep)

2. Identify when else the system might unintentionally leaves the deepest s=
leep
state while the screen stays off.
E.g. certain buttons, plug in/out events (USB devices, USB-C docking statio=
n,
AC power, HDMI, ...)
I'll try to think of some tests I can run for this.
You'll find the output of
  find /sys/devices/ -name wakeup -type f -print -exec cat '{}' \;
in the attachment.

3. Bring the s2idle power consumption further down below 2 % per hour.
