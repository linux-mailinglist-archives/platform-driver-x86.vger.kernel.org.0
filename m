It depends on how closely you are following the acpi specification.
If you just implement access to a standard ACPI feature, or you have
added your interface to the ACPI specification, then the driver
should work on any system that supports this feature.

drivers/platform/mellanox/ would be a good place for drivers running on
a host platform with a bluefield accelerator card as an add-on, but as I
understand, this is a driver that actually just runs in Linux on the bluefield
itself, so it should go in a different place.

We use drivers/soc/ for things that are specific to one SoC, and that
are typically used by other drivers, but that don't have (and should not
have) a generic abstraction, which probably is not the case here either.

What we do have in drivers/power/reset is a couple of drivers that
set the "reboot reason", communicating that to the firmware for the
next boot, using the reboot_mode_register() interface. I don't
know too much about that interface, but maybe you can use that
instead of adding another sysfs interface?

If you have a complex firmware on the system that you can talk
to, there is also drivers/firmware/ as another option to put
abstractions into.
