Perfect, thank you both! All of this makes perfect sense to me and I
will make these suggested changes.

I am planning to try and fix up some documentation which I will also
add for this platform driver, plus add relevant KConfig/Makefile/etc
entries, do some additional testing, and will try to get a patch
submitted here hopefully sometime within the next few days.

My plan was to take the latest commit at the time from the 'for-next'
branch of pdx86/platform-drivers-x86.git and then submit it all
together as a patch via a new thread here. Please let me know if there
are any problems with that plan or anything else I might need to
adjust before doing so.

Thank you again!

Best regards,
Joshua
