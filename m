Some more remarks from a quick look at the code, I see that
besides a netlink interface you are also creating a chardev
and doing ioctls on that.

That is really not good, it seems that the userspace API for
this needs to be completely redesigned. Using both netlink
and ioctls at the same time not acceptable.

Also you seem to create the chardev and netlink and
module-load time, rather then from the sar_add() probe
function. Which means that they will also be created on
laptops which don't have an INTC1092 ACPI device at all,
again not good.

Please drop the sar_init() and sar_exit() functions and
use module_platform_driver to have module_init / exit
register / unregister the driver and have them only do that,
everything else should be done from the platform_driver
probe function.

Also you use "sar" for a lot of identifiers in the driver,
but that is very generic where as this is a highly Intel
specific driver; and likely in the future even newer Intel
modems may use a different driver, so please replace the
sar prefix with something more specific, e.g. "intc1092"

Hans
