Short answer, "yes" it does not work for "3." and you can consider it
a broken.

I am not sure if there is a firmware versioning interface that the ASP
(AMD Security Processor) returns back the kernel/driver.

The code path in this case is:

AMD PMF driver -> AMD TEE driver -> AMD CCP driver -> ASP TEE -> ASP
TA -> ASP HW.

So, I uncertain which module has this information and where exactly
the code of fw versioning has to reside. It will take a while for me
to dig this in.

Meanwhile, shall I drop this patch and resend the series (by
addressing the dev_dbg change Mario commented) so that this atleast
becomes a 6.13 material?
