Hi Mark and Hans,

please see my reply inline.

Thank you and the FW team for the quick reply! As a first time
kernel hacker, I find my experience top-notch :)

My end goal is to hopefully get a bit more performance out of
my machine by making the fan kick in earlier using Thinkfan.

I have been doing a lot of compile-heavy development lately on
my X380 Yoga, and I noticed that the CPU will throttle down to
around 1.4 GHz at full load. This might just be normal for such
a small ultrabook, but I want to get the most out of it, as I'm
likely going to be stuck with this laptop for my first year of
CS studies.

Additionally, I remember the fans being louder at full load back
when I used Windows. With this patch, I can see that the highest
it gets is 4800 RPM. My memory might just be wrong though, and if so,
I apologize for wasting your time.

I have set "Adaptive Thermal Management" to "Maximize Performance"
in the BIOS, but I don't see a significant improvement.

Thank you again. In no way is this patch urgent, so feel free to
take your time.

This is correct, I did set fan_control=3D1 for my testing.
Writes to /proc/acpi/ibm/fan are rejected otherwise.
