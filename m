That might be true today, but maybe not tomorrow :)

Anyway, again, this is device state, not driver state.

So this is code that is already in the tree, and is just now being
documented?  What .c file(s) is this referring to?

As for "comptability", sysfs is made such that if a file is not present,
userspace should be able to survive, that is why it is
one-value-per-file.  What tool is using this, and where is the source
for it?
