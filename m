It's also interleaved responses :)

The problem is this driver will "bind" to any device it is loaded on,
which is not ok.  It must only work on hardware that it is known to work
on, as remember, Linux runs on hundreds of thousands of different
platforms and types of hardware.

Given a lack of documentation as to what this interface would be used
for, that needs to be resolved, along with links to userspace code that
uses this new api.
