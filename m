Subject: [PATCH RFC platform-next 8/8] Documentation/ABI: Add new line card attributes for mlxreg-io sysfs interfaces
Date:   Wed,  3 Feb 2021 19:36:22 +0200
Message-Id: <20210203173622.5845-9-vadimp@nvidia.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.11.0
In-Reply-To: <20210203173622.5845-1-vadimp@nvidia.com>
References: <20210203173622.5845-1-vadimp@nvidia.com>
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <platform-driver-x86.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: platform-driver-x86@vger.kernel.org

Add documentation for the new attributes for line cards:
- CPLDs versioning.
- Write protection control for 'nvram' devices.
- Line card reset reasons.
- Enabling burning of FPGA and CPLDs.
- Enabling burning of FPGA and gearbox SPI flashes,
- Enabling power of whole line card.
- Enabling power of QSFP ports equipped on line card.
- The maximum powered required for line card feeding.
- Line card configuration Id.
