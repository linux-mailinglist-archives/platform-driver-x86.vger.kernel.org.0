Hi Ilpo and Armin and thank you for the replies; these are exactly the
kind of questions I was hoping for! :)

Yes, the kernel creates an ACPI device exactly as you asked.

As a bit of history: much of how this driver is structured came from
inspiration I took from existing platform/x86 drivers and this pattern
of having an acpi_driver followed by the platform_driver seems to be
more common than not from what I can see (except for specific cases
like the the WMI-specific drivers for example). I took a cursory look
and it does seem possible to do as you say, but I would still need to
grab a handle to the ACPI device somehow of course, and the full path
might be different for different models, so from what I can tell it
feels a bit more "clumsy" because I don't see any function which will
allow me to pass an array of acpi_device_id or strings but instead
would need to loop through the array and within the loop see if I get
a match and fetch the device that way (e.g. using something like
acpi_dev_get_first_match_dev()). Is this in fact the preferred
approach now? (and just so happens that many of the existing
platform/x86 drivers do not follow this design currently?) I am of
course happy to take this in either direction, but would just want to
know what the preference is so that I know what to do next on it!

(Similar comment/question from both of you on this)
I have now gone over to using dynamic debug in the driver now instead
of a custom debug module parameter, and revamped quite a lot of the
print stuff. Now much of the previous information has been moved to
debug but there are still a few cases which warrant warn or error I
think.

One thing I feel like does actually add some value to print to INFO is
that, because how some of the dynamic features will work can vary for
different models, to me it seems like it would be a good thing to
actually tell the user about these specific things (e.g. only power
profiles x, y, z will be available and will be mapped to vendor
performance modes a, b, c, ... just as an example). Otherwise I can
understand how there would be a fair amount of confusion about what
actually happens when you press the hotkey or try and toggle the modes
using various services (power-profiles-daemon, etc..). To me, I see
these messages as similar to what prints to INFO when for example a
new input device is added, a new battery extension is added, etc. Does
this sound ok or should ALL of these kind of prints be moved to debug
instead?


I will also try to reach out to Hans directly to ask this question
regarding if it would make sense to handle hotkey work actions from
the platform driver or not. Otherwise, I feel like once I can resolve
these other two main questions I asked here ( 1) register acpi_driver
vs looping array to get the dev handle and 2) printing some of these
last dynamic things to info vs debug ), then I will go ahead and tidy
up the rest of the bits and send in a patch here.

Thank you again!

Best regards,
Joshua
