Some comments below based on possible use in power-profiles-daemon:

The Intel P-State driver in the kernel supports 4 separate ones (plus
default):
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/cpufreq/intel_pstate.c#n591
which we crammed into 3 profiles:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/hadess/power-profiles-daemon/-/blob/master/src/ppd-driver-intel-pstate.c#L209-226

Are the square brackets to show the currently selected profile? I'd
rather it was a separate sysfs attribute. I would expect to only ever
read the list of supported profiles once, and then monitor an "active
profile" attribute.

(a bit like the intel_pstate kernel driver does, but then all the
devices that support Intel P-State support all the profiles, so it's
not a good example ;)

I think it's fine having more than 3 profiles. Something like power-
profiles-daemon would likely trying to match them all to one of the 3
profiles it uses as an interface, or forcing the use of those 3
profiles, depending on what that profile behaves.

Compared to the WIP lenovo-dytc "perfmode" driver, we're missing
something to advertise the unavailability of a profile, and the reason
for that unavailability.
