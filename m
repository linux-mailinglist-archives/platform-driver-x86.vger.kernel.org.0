Yeah my though was: this check is only here to catch the firmware doing some 
crazy stuff and sending highly unrealistic values, so gifting a small bit of the 
available range away doesn't matter

I'm sorry. I just wanted to show that I'm iterating as I wait for the reply if 
the design with the periodic safeguard is acceptable. If that's gets rejected 
this driver must be rewritten anyway.

I can add an explicit cast, np.

Yes that's intentional, the 3 entries in the array open up 4 ranges:

lower then 1st entry i=0, between 1st and 2nd entry i=1, 2nd and 3rd i=2, higher 
then 3rd i=3 (the value that terminates the for loop)

I can add it.

Thanks for the code review again.


Last but not least: As already mentioned, I still wonder if the design with the 
periodic safeguard is ok or not or?

Best regards,

Werner
