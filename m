Thanks, I assumed all _ec variants are called from the similarly named=20
getter/setter but apparently there are exceptions I didn't notice until=20
now.

No objection, just put the new stuff into own patch.

The get side should still be thought at this point as it affects what the=

struct layuout should be. The only way to do the reverse mapping will the=
=20
current struct layout is using one if () per a struct member (e.g. loop is=

going to be impractical). Perhaps some union+array trickery could allow=20
looping through them while retaining the current way to name the fields.

Fine. Doing it in smaller steps is easier to review anyway.
