But it does matter as you could note. I stumbled on the logic which didn't=
=20
look right while reviewing. You even claimed afterwards is not wrong when=
=20
I raised this. :-/

Please just correct the logic so it makes sense to the code reader, there=
=20
seems to be no well justified reason to keep the illogical code even if=20
the practical impact is very low. It's probably done the way it is only=20
because the variable types are what they are so you couldn't do the=20
subtraction like I proposed ;-). At minimum you'd need to add a comment to=
=20
warn about the inconsistency at which point rewriting to correct logic is=
=20
already way simpler.

Kernel development is not a sprint. It's better to avoid sending versions=
=20
unnecessarily, a day or two isn't worth it when compared with ending up=20
into people's low priority bin which will inevitably happen when the=20
version counter starts to grow beyond v5-6.

I (and likely others too) appreciate if they don't have to waste review=20
cycles on something that is not "complete" because we have to look at the=
=20
completed one later too. Maintainers work in good faith that developers=20
are simply improving their patches (or working on some other great=20
improvements to the kernel :-)) while nothing seemingly happens for a=20
while. There's no need to prove that something is going on just for the=20
sake of proving.

Obviously RFC patches are still fine to ask specific questions about=20
something, but that's not about proving progress (in fact, RFC patches are=
=20
more about being "stuck" than about making progress).

I didn't realize that. To me { } looks just an terminating entry. So=20
what's the min_speed going to be for that last entry since it's=20
initialized to 0?

Oh, I see you're taking .min_speed from temp_levels[temp_level - 1] which
I don't like either. You have a "state" and then store min_speed for the=20
state into other index inside the array?!?

I'm not sure if fully understand Daniel's suggestion [1] as it=20
doesn't specify who/what is sending that notification to the thermal=20
engine.

When it comes to your own concerns, I'm not exactly buying the argument=20
that userspace can do dangerous things. Yeah, it can shoot one's own=20
foot, no doubt, such as unloading this driver and there goes your periodic=
=20
safeguards. If the argument would be that userspace fails to respond (in=20
time), I would have less trouble in accepting that argument.
