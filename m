Anyway; I'll update this to re-trigger if the IC is in torch mode within the timeout (which the datasheet explicitly says you can do in torch mode; the current is much more heavily limited in that mode) and in the flash mode to update the brightness setting to 0 once the timeout expires so it reflects the actual state of the LED. Does that sound ok?

That sounds reasonable to me.

Hans
