Hi,

Correction, there is something different this time around. Last time there

were other keys that had the same scan codes as each other. They are still

working now. This results in a win of four keys, yay.

Yeah, but I still cannot say with confidence it's not something else.

Sound like an interesting workaround. Unfortunately there is no BIOS

option for this and the battery is not easily removable.Â  I do not want

to risk damaging my battery as this is a very expensive laptop. Thanks

for the help though. I will update when something interesting happens
