Just a small clarification - in our case High performance is only for 
deskmode. It drops to Medium in lapmode.
Medium mode is slightly different in power rating between lap and desk 
mode (e.g on X1Carbon 14.5W on lap, 15W on desk). I haven't really 
worried about this in my patch implementation - it's still "medium"

Does that make it better or more confusing?
