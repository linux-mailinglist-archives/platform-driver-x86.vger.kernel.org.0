I see, we once had a similar case with the dell-wmi driver, see commit f97=
e058cfe80 ("platform/x86: wmi: Don't allow drivers to get each other's GUI=
Ds"):

	The only driver using this was dell-wmi, and it really was a hack.
     	The driver was getting a data attribute from another driver and this
     	type of action should not be encouraged.

     	Rather drivers that need to interact with one another should pass
     	data back and forth via exported functions.

I would be quite unhappy with drivers interacting with WMI devices without=
 a proper WMI driver, but i can see your point here.

Maybe we can keep the retrieval of the fanX_max values out of the kernel? =
I propose the following:

- have a driver for your generic ACPI interface
- have a driver for the WMI interface (with fanX_max hwmon attributes)

The driver for the generic ACPI interface exposes the fan speed controls a=
s pwmX attributes if the interface does not support
the "Get Max RPM" function. The userspace application in this case searche=
s for the hwmon chip exposed by the WMI driver and
reads the fanX_max attributes there. Then the application can convert the =
target fan speed into values for the pwmX attributes
itself.
If the ACPI interface however supports the "Get Max RPM" function, then it=
 exposes fanX_max and fanX_target hwmon attributes
themself and the userspace application uses them directly.

This would keep the kernel drivers simple.

I suppose you provide some sort of OEM application for fan control? In thi=
s case having the fanX_max handling here also gives
you full control and allows you to stay independent from the kernel develo=
pment in that regard. For example you might decide
independently to hardcode the max. RPM values on some machines (like the t=
wo new machines) or use a different hwmon chip on
some other machine.

Aside from that, i really like your approach with having a generic ACPI in=
terface, it can potentially save you a lot of work
once you have the initial driver.
