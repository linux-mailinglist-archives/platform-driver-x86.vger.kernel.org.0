Hello!=20
=20
This is a seventh spin of the patch set that adds support for the Embedde=
d=20
Controller on an OLPC XO 1.75 machine.=20

The only patch that changed since v6 is [06/10]: there are fixes for
problems reported by Julia Lawall and the kbuild test robot.

The patch set depends on changes to the OLPC battery driver that have=20
landed in the power-supply tree. Sebastian Reichel provided an signed
tag of an immutable branch that has the necessary bits and was merged
into the power-supply tree for 5.2:=20
=20
  git pull git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sre/linux-power-=
supply.git psy-olpc-1.75-battery-signed=20

The patch [10/10] was split of from the rest because Russell King found t=
he=20
patch [09/10] it depends on possibly objectionable. They should not be=20
applied without further input from Russell.

Thank you,=20
Lubo=20
