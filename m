Hi Greg,

That would mean that we start maintaining something like DMI quirk
table in those drivers. Unfortunately the IOM device is not available
on every platform. Also, even on platforms that do have it, there is
no guarantee that the device is always going to be mapped to the same
address.

Nevertheless, I was originally hoping that we could hide the handling
of IOM somehow in ACPI without the need for an actual device object,
but it now turns out that the other features of the IOM chip have
created interest. At least our i915 guys probable have some use for it
(I don't know exactly what they are planning to use it for).

So the fact that we may later need the device for something else, on
top of the clumsiness and most importantly risks involved with using
ACPI to take care of extra tasks (ASL tends to have bugs - bugs that
may never ever get fixed), I think the IOM device object, and the
driver that binds to it, do have a valid reason for existing.


thanks,
