Note that the fallback stuff would not apply here, since you do provide
all 3 of low-power, balanced and performance. But the current way gnome
will handle this means that it will be impossible to select "normal" from
the GNOME ui which feels wrong.

Ack.

So that means that this is going to need to have a preparation patch
adding the 2 balanced variants which I mention above. Can you take care
of that in the next version?

And since that prep. patch needs to go through Rafael's PM tree anyways,
maybe also throw in a patch to make ACPI_PLATFORM_PROFILE not user selectable
and use select on it in the thinkpad_acpi and ideapad_laptop drivers?

Regards,

Hans
