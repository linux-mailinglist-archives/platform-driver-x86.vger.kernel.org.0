Thought about this some and I'm in agreement. My vote is to keep the 
first version simple and see where we go from there based on user feedback.

I'm going to make the lapmode information available via debugfs for 
those users who do want to see it anyway - and this exercise is really 
about the user space controller so I can see how fitting in all these 
extra pieces just makes it awkward.

I had some other thoughts but I think they tag on better to Elia's email 
so I'll save those for there
