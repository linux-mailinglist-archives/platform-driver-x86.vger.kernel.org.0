For the helper function, I noticed that all of the CLASS_TOKEN_WRITEs
also have SELECT_TOKEN_STD except for one (dell_send_intensity). So I
think it makes sense to have the helper function also do that as well.
Eg,

static inline int dell_set_std_token_value(struct calling_interface_buffer =
*buffer, u16 tokenid, u32 value)
{
	dell_send_request_for_tokenid(buffer, SELECT_TOKEN_STD, CLASS_TOKEN_WRITE,=
 tokenid, value);
}

I agree with your renaming to dell_send_request_for_tokenid, btw.

I ended up returning -EIO here, with the logic that if we're getting
some nonsense value from SMBIOS, it could either be junk in the stored
values or communication corruption.

Likewise, I used -EIO for the checks in charge_control_start_threshold_show
and charge_control_end_threshold_show when SMBIOS returns values > 100%.

I think it makes the comparison much easier to read. I'd prefer to
keep it, unless the coding style specifically forbids it.

So from userspace, we've got the expectation that multiple batteries
would show up as /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0, /sys/class/power_supply/BAT1,
and so on.

The current BAT0 entry shows things like 'capacity' even without this
patch, and we're just piggybacking off of that to add charge_type and
other entries. So there shouldn't be any confusion there, agreed?

In the kernel, we're registering the acpi_battery_hook as "Dell Primary
Battery Extension". The functions set up by that acpi_battery_hook are
the only ones using battery_support_modes. We could make it more explicit
by:
1) renaming it to primary_battery_modes, along with
dell_primary_battery_{init,exit} and/or
2) allocating the mode mask and strings dynamically, and storing that
inside of the dev kobject.

However, #2 seems overly complicated for what we're doing. In the
circumstances that we want to add support for secondary batteries,
we're going to need to query separate tokens, add another
acpi_battery_hook, and also add a second mask. Whether that's a global
variable or kept inside pdev seems like more of a style issue than
anything else.

#1 is easy enough to change, if you think that's necessary.
