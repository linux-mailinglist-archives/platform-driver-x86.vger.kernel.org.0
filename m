I may have missed something, but if you load the SGo2 board file, won't
it create the regulator software nodes if it finds an INT3472,
regardless of whether the device is an SGo2 ? If you happen to do so on
a machine that requires different voltages, that sounds dangerous.

Given that INT3472 models the virtual "Intel Skylake and Kabylake camera
PMIC", I think moving device-specific information to the int3472 driver
may make sense. I'm unsure what option is best though, having all the
data (regulators, clocks, but also data currently stored in the
cio2-bridge driver) in a single file (or a single file per machine) is
tempting.
