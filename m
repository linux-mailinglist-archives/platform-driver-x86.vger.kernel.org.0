So assign an array of the init_data to the i2c-INT3472:nn device as
platform data before registering the MFD cells in
intel_skl_int3472_tps68470.c and parse that out when the regulators
register. OK - that's fine by me.

Err, excellent point - I hadn't thought of that if I'm honest.

The tps65023-regulator driver parses init data out of platform data yes.
I think that that's fine, but personally I'd prefer that done in core.c
rather than in the regulator driver itself if possible.
