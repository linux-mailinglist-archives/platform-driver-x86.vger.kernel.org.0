Good, so now we know that it is some embedded-controller setting which Windows
(or likely some HP specific sw/drivers under Windows) enables, which is causing
this problem.

Nothing comes to mind, but maybe others have some good ideas ?  One thing which you
could do is contact HP about this and see if they are willing to provide some help.

If they can just tell us which WMI method (I'm guessing it is a WMI method) Windows
is calling and what we can do to undo that; or how to receive the events in the same
way Windows is receiving them then that would be helpful.

The other options is some kernel-dev with some ACPI/WMI experience getting their
hands on an affected device and then poke around a bit and hopefully figure out
a solution.

Regards,

Hans
