As I understand the problem with the configured and actual value/performance_level ideas is that if I understand things correctly that H* is not the same as M,
it behaves close-ish to M because of the lower thermal-limits from lapmode, but if I understood Benjamin correctly is is not exactly the same, so if we were
to advertise "M" in the actual_performance_level sysfs-attribute then that would not really be correct ?
