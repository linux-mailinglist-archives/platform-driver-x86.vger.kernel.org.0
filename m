You should not need to reset the GPU for S3 if the device is properly power=
ed
down on suspend.  The reset on suspend was to workaround the case where sus=
pend
failed and we needed a to put the GPU into a clean state to resume without =
the
GPU having been powered down.  I think the reason this helped you was becau=
se
the platform was not actually getting properly powered down so the GPU was
never powered off, thus on resume the GPU was in an unknown state.  SO you =
were
not actually getting proper suspend in the first place.
