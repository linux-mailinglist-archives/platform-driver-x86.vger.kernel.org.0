I did get the point I think and was why I said both "I do think that
something should change" and specifically when I said "And by the way,
that, as you say, we should probably not fail the entire feature just
because of this, but let the error happen anyway and let everything
work after that." I can imagine that with my wall of words it is easy
that the message could get lost in there -- that is on me :)

But regardless, yes, it should not return here, but I was more
thinking about how to better/more cleanly handle the situation so that
the logic is less "hacky", if that makes sense :)
