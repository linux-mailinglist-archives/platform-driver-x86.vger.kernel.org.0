The problem is that we cannot rule out that the LPS0 display off
call relies on the displays actually being off.

I have seen ACPI AML code do all sort of crazy stuff.

So IMHO we really need to make sure that all physical displays
are off before we make the LPS0 display off call.

I have read what you wrote about this also applying to virtual
displays, I guess that means that there should be no rendering done
(so also no GPU non display tasks) when this is called.

IOW it might be best to tie this to all VGA class PCI devices
being in D3 as Mario suggested.

Regards,

Hans
