Ah, if there is nothing using that information yet, then just don't
pass it at all for now. As you said, it's kernel internal API, we can
change it later if needed.

Why are you against passing all the data that we have? What is the
benefit in picking only certain details out of an object that has a
standard format, and constructing a customised object for those
details instead?
