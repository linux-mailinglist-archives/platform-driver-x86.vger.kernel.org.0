OK, thanks for the clarification. I guess in this case we can probably
just live without using it, if that's fine for Lee and others. The new
MFD driver itself is ~500 lines so not sure how much regmap would help
there, and we only expose two simple functions for the subdevices both
dealing with 64-bit registers.
