Do you think it's better to just add new entries, just as they are in
the EFI memmap and then let e820__update_table handle them?

Although, as it is it's faster, the other way would be clearer in the
code (since efi_mark_e820_regions_as_crypto_capable in part 4/5 isn't
also the nicest of the functions and with this change it would be very
straightforward), but it would require one e820__update_table. Also,
it would more accurate, since if you call this with a start and size
that doesn't cover at least one e820_entry then it will do nothing.

You're right, I'll fix that.

The reason for that is that right now, if a region is mark as
crypto_capable is because EFI memmap says so, and again, right now
that's the only source to fill the crypto_capable value, so I have to
"believe" it. Now that I think about it, yes I should have a least put
a comment on it.

Yes, "crypto" and "type" seems really close, but to be honest, this
function has a very weird flow, or something that I couldn't
completely understand. After a while thinking about it I came up with
that.

Again, this function is a pain, but I'll dedicate it some more time to
see if I can come up with something better.

I thought it would be good to add it and mark it all together, but I
can add it and then mark it, no problem.

This was tested on my laptop that doesn't have the EFI attribute, so I
faked it, bypassing the check for this attribute in
efi_mark_e820_regions_as_crypto_capable (patch 4/5).
