Mark who's the maintainer seems to be against it, so I don't want to step
too strongly on his lot in this. It's merely my opinion how we normally=20
handle cases like this (I probably didn't express that clearly enough).

That being said, I think there are very good reasons for the 100 limit=20
but it also varies how imporant the bit that is very right columnwise is=20
(and function parameters that don't contain odd logic in them are quite=20
low on that list, only little above container_of() boilerplate).

I do run sparse almost daily here and it's warnings are much more valuable=
=20
over checkpatch's (excluding the recent addition of "error: bad constant=20
expression" madness thanks to Kees (IIRC) which I now have to filter away=
=20
~forever)!

I'm also under impression that kasan also points out problems which are=20
not pure stylistics preferences.

However, when we start to remove extra parenthesis because checkpatch has=
=20
some rule that doesn't like using parenthesis to group logic, and somebody=
=20
has to spend cycles to review those patches, I think we've reached a point=
=20
of negative returns. It's surprisingly hard to visually check such patch=20
for correct nesting, so there's a real risk as well with it.

I'm not entirely convinced by all checkpatch rules to begin with, one=20
needs to take its output with a grain of salt.

It's just finding a logic issue has way more value than pure syntax=20
changes. Perhaps checkpatch doesn't teach much about tools needed for=20
"real" contributions ;-) (I can see some value in learning to deal with=20
the patch submission and feedback process though).

And if you really intend to work with these drivers beyond cleanup you're=
=20
now submitting to, I certainly find it less disruptive than doing it on a=
=20
large-scale to random things.
