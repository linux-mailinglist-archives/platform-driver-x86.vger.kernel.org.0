Actually we already use this format in power-supply for USB
types, implemented in power_supply_show_usb_type().

If it's two files, then somebody needs to come up with proper=20
names. Things like 'force_discharge' look sensible in this context,
but on a system with two batteries (like some Thinkpads have) it
is easy to confuse with "I want to discharge this battery before
the other one (while no AC is connected)".
