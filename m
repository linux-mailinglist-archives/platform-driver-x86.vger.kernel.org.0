After testing, thankfully it seems to be the case that it is mostly
sleeping!

I will try to look into this, hopefully this weekend, though I'm currently
down with a nasty cold, so I can't promise anything.

These are separate: A shared one for AC current and AC voltage, and two
separate ones for battery current and battery voltage. There is also
more data in the AC reply one that I can't quite decode, but it seems to
be thermally related (but I have not managed to decode it as a temperature
that matches anything else). Annoyingly the windows software displays
almost everything in percentages on dial gauges without any units or even
scales, making actually figuring out the interpretations rather difficult
at times.

For reading the power a call is can be issued to set the time resolution,
in powers of two between 1 and 16 (i.e. 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 are valid values),
where 1 is slightly more than one new reading per second, while 16 is about
one reading every 20ish seconds.

This suggests that the EC would be updating some periodic registers
internally and we are just querying them, however, these are still just as
slow to read as the fan.

I do seem to have voltage_now and power_now. So current could be computed
by measuring the delta of energy_now over time and then using the voltage
to compute the current.

However, the voltage as reported in /sys/class/power_supply/BAT1 does not
quite match the voltage I get from the HCI calls. The HCI call consistently
reads higher, but how much higher depends on if the AC is connected or not.
Also voltage_now seems to update rather more slowly than the HCI calls.

Yes they are slow, but they might be interesting in order to compute
system power usage while on AC (AC power - battery power) as it reports
the battery charging current while charging and the discharging current
while discharging.

At the very least I will be documenting them when I get time.

Right, I saw those, I was just waiting for the reply to the cover letter
before submitting the next version.

Ah, good to know. This should be fine, it is not exactly urgent, given
that the computer is from 2011.
