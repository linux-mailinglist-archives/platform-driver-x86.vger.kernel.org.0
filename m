Excellent! I was just trying to pull together something similar based on =
the individual schematic
documents!

I think this supports the proposal on the table already, that we should p=
refer naming to be "modem
orientated", rather than "pcie slot" orientated.

For example, on APU2, the PE3/4_RST lines are wired to PCIe slots 1 & 2 (=
which are the two with USB)
But on APU4, the PE3_RST reset, USB and SIM lines move from slot 1 to slo=
t 3.

So on APU4, you don't get the control over wireless disable (and reset is=
 hazy) on the mpcie slot 1
for the wifi card. But in all cases the use of the reset/enable lines fol=
low the modem slots, not
the wifi slots

So I maintain my proposal that it's far better to name the GPIOs relative=
 to the USB & modem slots,
since this is how they are being used on ALL schematics. Especially on AP=
U5 (which is the oddball,
having 3x modems + 6x SIMs), this is very much the case

(Also, Enrico, you should beware that your current use might not be worki=
ng as you expect, because I
don't see that you have control over the wifi card enable on APU4 at all?=
)

If we are now in agreement, perhaps we can proceed? I think if we make pr=
ogress here, then I might
also send in a patch to wire up all the other GPIOs.

Thanks all

Ed W
