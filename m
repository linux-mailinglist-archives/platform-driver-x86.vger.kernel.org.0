If you're talking about the ACPI implementation on those machines,
nobody disagrees :-)

To make sure I understand you correctly, do you advocate for suppressing
registration of the I2C devices from ACPI and instantiate them from
board code instead, or to somehow supplement the I2C device with
board-specific data ?
