Okay, so I read this as stating that its testing for a larger set of 
features than what can be read from the code.

This kinda digressed and didn't answer my question at all (you mentioned 
Spill to DRAM zero times in your reply but went to something called STB). 
But it could just that I'm not familiar enough with all the details here.

My question boiled down to if this (your own words) is true or not:

"The check for amd_pmc_check_sup_cpuid() is to see if the underlying CPU
(with the right PMFW support) supported is pre-Rembrandt, then Spill 
to DRAM is not supported. ... But the platforms after Rmebrandt, supports 
spilling to DRAM, ..."

If the code is solely used for testing whether Spill to DRAM is supported 
or not, it feels odd to name it something more generic than that. But 
given what you said above, I guess the answer here is that it can be used 
to test Spill to DRAM among other things, and this particular patch 
just doesn't do those other things so it looks odd but is okay still.
Is that the correct interpretation here?

Given you seem to be certain there's no error or some detail missing, I 
won't object it being the way you want to put it.
