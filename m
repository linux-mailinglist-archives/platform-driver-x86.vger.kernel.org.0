It depends on luck, bioses, hw schematic and so on. Main issue is bios does=
 not
provide known methods for sensor access and does not use global mutex before
access to the region related to sensors, and mutual access could be not
possible with such bios implementation. It works without known issues for o=
ther
boards with mutex lock (P8H67, X99-E WS/USB 3.1). Other boards could have
issues, like example it can be such:
https://github.com/electrified/asus-wmi-sensors#known-issues. Its different
driver but issues could be the same.
