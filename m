Sorry, but "Type B" is even more confusing here. Type B refers to the
Standard-B USB connector, so _not_ the micro connector family. You can
check the connector definitions from the latest USB 3.2 specification.
The standard-b definition goes something like this:

        "The standard _Type-B_ connector defined by the USB x specification."

Note that all the five supported connectors are listed in ch5
"Mechanical":

        Standard-A
        Standard-B
        Micro-B
        Micro-AB
        Type-C

So what was the problem with names that refer to the micro connector
family, for example "micro-ab" or "micro-b"?
