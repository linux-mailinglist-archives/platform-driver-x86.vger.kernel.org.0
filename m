Which "old names" are you referring to ?
The really old apuv1 led-only driver ?

Exactly. Linus often stated "dont break userland" as a primary goal, and
that with really good reasons: the kernel is *the* hardware abstraction
layer. Having userland to deal with thousands of hardware details in
userland would cause extreme management complexity.

Not quite. SIM swap hasn't been actually used in the field (at least as
far as I know). And we're planning to put it into different subsystem
(probably rfkill) anyways.

Small kernel update causes existing applications to FAIL. Applications
now have to be changed to deal with *different* configuration, based on
factors like BIOS version.

We're dealing with embedded applications. There is no operator of these
boxes. Maybe some times an operator of the machinary comes around - and
needs to rely on the LEDs. Not as critial as an direction indicator in
a car, but still important.
