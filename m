I didn't decompile the ymc.exe, just watched the acpi/wmi trace logs, 
while stopped and started the ymc service, and figured out what it can 
do. After mode changes I saw the VPCW,VPCW,VPCR pattern, what I saw 
before in the ideapad-laptop.c as write_ec_cmd. Then tried with the 
unknown cmds, and the 0x2A worked.

The 0xAB came from the object_id of debug_dump_wdg by mistake.

[    1.562801] wmi: 09B0EE6E-C3FD-4243-8DA1-7911FF80BB8C:
[    1.562802] wmi: 	object_id: AB
[    1.562803] wmi: 	instance_count: 1
[    1.562804] wmi: 	flags: 0x2 ACPI_WMI_METHOD

The correct one is the 0x01 here also.

[WMI, Dynamic, Provider("WmiProv"), Locale("MS\\0x409"), 
Description("LENOVO_GSENSOR_DATA class"), 
guid("{09B0EE6E-C3FD-4243-8DA1-7911FF80BB8C}")]
class LENOVO_GSENSOR_DATA {
   [key, read] string InstanceName;
   [read] boolean Active;

   [WmiMethodId(1), Implemented, Description("Mode Data")] void 
GetUsageMode([out, Description("Mode Data")] uint32 Data);
   [WmiMethodId(2), Implemented, Description("Get Xaxis Value")] void 
GetXaxisValue([out, Description("Get Xaxis Value")] uint32 Data);
   [WmiMethodId(3), Implemented, Description("Get Yaxis Value")] void 
GetYaxisValue([out, Description("Get Yaxis Value")] uint32 Data);
   [WmiMethodId(4), Implemented, Description("Get Zaxis Value")] void 
GetZaxisValue([out, Description("Get Zaxis Value")] uint32 Data);
   [WmiMethodId(5), Implemented, Description("Base to Ground")] void 
GetAngle4Value([out, Description("Base to Ground")] uint32 Data);
   [WmiMethodId(6), Implemented, Description("Screen to Ground")] void 
GetAngle5Value([out, Description("Screen to Ground")] uint32 Data);
   [WmiMethodId(7), Implemented, Description("Screen to Base")] void 
GetAngle6Value([out, Description("Screen to Base")] uint32 Data);
};

It works with any id
Method (WMAB, 3, NotSerialized)
{
    Return (^^PCI0.LPC0.EC0.YGAM) /* \_SB_.PCI0.LPC0.EC0_.YGAM */
}


I've found one thing, in this line

priv->ec_acpi_dev = acpi_dev_get_first_match_dev("VCP2004", NULL, -1);

the correct hw id is "VPC2004", not "VCP2004".

With this modification, it works well.

According to Hans, it's unrealistic that Lenovo will change this 
triggering behavior, so it can remain.

Thanks,
