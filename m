Yes, led_classdev_notify_brightness_hw_changed() will also inform userspace
about the brightness being changed by the hw itself and at least upower
and GNOME support this. One problem is that upower does not know that the
new /sys/class/leds/hp:rgb:kbd_zoned_backlight-<zone> devices are for
a backlit keyboard. So for testing what you could do is name one of the
zones in the driver "hp:rgb:kbd_backlight". Then GNOME should show
the nice on screen notification when you toggle the brightness with the key,
if you call led_classdev_notify_brightness_hw_changed() on all 4 led_classdev-s
when this happens.

> For me it would make sense to tell the user that the brightness key was pressed.

Right and that is what led_classdev_notify_brightness_hw_changed() does.

The difference is led_classdev_notify_brightness_hw_changed() is for notifying
of the hw changing the brightness itself, where as KEY_KBDILLUMTOGGLE key press
events ask of userspace to toggle the brightness itself. You are not seeing
userspace toggling the brightness itself with your testing because upower
does not support /sys/class/leds/<foo>:rgb:kbd_zoned_backlight-<zone> devices
yet. But once it does support those then sending KEY_KBDILLUMTOGGLE will not
only show the on screen notification it will also cause GNOME to toggle
the brightness (a second time) basically undoing the hw toggle.

So basically we have 1 on/off toggle for the entire keyboard and 12 rgb channels
as controls.

So my suggestion would be to do as I proposed previously which is to use
the standard multi-color LED model / helpers with an overall brightness value
per zone and multi_intensity with 3 values for the R / G / B ratio and then
set the global on/off toggle to off if all 4 main brightness values are
set to off (to zero).

So then the brightness_set() callback function should do something like this:

#define KBD_ZONE_COUNT 4

struct hp_fourzone_led {
 	struct led_classdev_mc mc_led;
 	struct mc_subled subleds[3];
	/*
	 * This stores the last set brightness level to restore it on off->on toggle
	 * by the FN-key combo.
	 */
 	enum led_brightness brightness;
};

static void set_fourzone_brightness(struct led_classdev *led_cdev, enum led_brightness brightness)
{
	u8 buff[4] = { };
	int i, zone = 0;
	bool on = false;

	for (i = 0; i < KBD_ZONE_COUNT; i++)
		if (strcmp(led_cdev->name, fourzone_zone_names[i]) == 0)
			zone = i;

	/* Always update main and per color brightness values even when the backlight is off */
	fourzone_leds[zone].brightness = brightness;
	fourzone_leds[zone].mc_led.led_cdev.brightness = brightness;
	led_mc_calc_color_components(&fourzone_leds[zone].mc_led, brightness);

	/* Update the RGB channels for the current zone */
	/* This should use a new version of fourzone_set_colors() which sends
           the fourzone_leds[zone].subleds[0 - 2].brightness to the kbd */
	fourzone_set_colors(zone);

	for (i = 0; i < KBD_ZONE_COUNT; i++)
		if (fourzone_leds[i].mc_led.led_cdev.brightness)
			on = true;

	buff[0] = on ? FOURZONE_LIGHTING_ON : FOURZONE_LIGHTING_OFF;	
	hp_wmi_perform_query(HPWMI_LED_BRIGHTNESS_SET, HPWMI_FOURZONE, &buff, sizeof(buff), 0);
}

Admittedly this is the easier part. The harder part is what to do on
brightness_get() I would not implement a brightness_get() callback, since
that then will be called every time userspace reads the brightness. Since
there is an event when the brightness is changed underneath us by the hw
we don't need to poll the hw. By leaving out the brightness_get() callback
we get to control when we read back the info from the hw.

So instead of implementing a brightness_get() callback, there should be
a helper to get the state of the global on/off toggle and use this in
probe() to set initial brightness values.

Also the actual brightness level (without the on/off toggle taking into
account) should now become an extra member of struct hp_fourzone_led
replacing the old cache this should always represent the latest brightness
value set by either probe() or userspace calling set_brightness() even if
the toggle is off (I already added this above).

And then on events that the Fn-key combo is used, call the helper to get
the new state.

If the new state is off, set fourzone_leds[0-3].mc_led.led_cdev.brightness
to 0 for all 4 zones *before* calling
led_classdev_notify_brightness_hw_changed(), so that when userspace reads
/sys/class/leds/hp:rgb:kbd_zoned_backlight-<zone>/brightness it will read 0.

If the new state is on, restore the old brightness levels saved in
fourzone_leds[i].brightness to fourzone_leds[i].mc_led.led_cdev.brightness
*before* calling led_classdev_notify_brightness_hw_changed().

This way we correctly reflect the on/off toggle state to userspace, making
/sys/class/leds/hp:rgb:kbd_zoned_backlight-<zone>/brightness read 0 when
it is off, while otherwise making things behave as standard multi-color
LED class devices.

No worries, that is what the review process is for :)
