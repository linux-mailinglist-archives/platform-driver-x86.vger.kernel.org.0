s/represent/represents/
s/socket id/socket ID/

As a user, how do I learn the socket instance?  Look at dmesg?  Look
at some other sysfs file?

"CAP file" sounds like it might be redundant.  It *seems* like the
*payload* is what will be validated by SDSi and activate the feature.
Not sure "file" is meaningful if this is really talking about the
content of the CAP.
