Fundamentally, it is more complicated and error prone than 2 systemd
suspend targets that fire at the same time DEs lock the lock screen
(or any init system for that matter). This pseudocode also hardcodes
the delay and does not debounce the display on callback.

There is the theoretical risk of a device misbehaving if the callbacks
fire at the wrong time. But this risk is theoretical and could be
solved by a device driver quirk that blocks the transition for that
specific device. Which is also much simpler than trying to hardcode an
implementation that works with all devices.

For all the devices I tested, the display calls change the
presentation of the device such as RGB or aux devices that drain power
during suspend. I do not see a connection to DRM. This points me to
userspace being more appropriate for handling this. It also solves all
UX edge cases because userspace knows when it is inactive.

Userspace handling this will not be backwards compatible in the sense
that it will not fire when the displays turn off with current
userspace. But it preserves current behavior and as such it is not a
breaking change.

The most useful thing would be maintaining some basic connectivity so
that the device can resume faster if it suspended a couple of minutes
before and handling transitions such as to hibernation. The transition
to hibernation is especially important, as if both DPMS and the sleep
transition fire the transition looks proper. Being able to run certain
maintenance tasks without changing the presentation of the device from
sleep (e.g., the APM timer to check the battery level) is important.

Even without that, if userspace transitions to sleep and fires DPMS
before beginning freezing and the suspend sequence, it halfs the user
perceived delay to sleep. It is a big deal. This is a planned feature
for the next version of bazzite so I am testing it right now. It looks
really professional.

I do sympathize with this. The most important part would be to lower
the power limit of the device which the manufacturers can already do
via the notification and perhaps other kernel drivers could do too.
Non-root software can be limited by the init system in general.

As a side note, after all tasks have frozen, including compositors,
you can fire DPMS safely before beginning the suspend sequence for
backwards compatibility and to lower the span the old framebuffer is
shown. This would be a useful addition to this series.
