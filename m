For Windows-based machines, yes. It's fairly new, and the information I
have is that those machines may ship DSDT containing both Windows-style
(read: crap) data and Linux-style data for the same nodes. My fear is
that only the former will be properly tested and the latter will thus be
incorrect. The future will tell (I'm as usual very hopeful).
