Hi Hans,

I got another issue on the same platform.
The first issue was that when set to DSC graphics only in the BIOS,
I encountered the issue I reported here, dell_laptop creates dell_backlight
and then nvidia creates nvidia_0 later.

Now, set to hybrid mode in the BIOS, I found I still got 2 backlight interf=
aces
   $ ls /sys/class/backlight/
   acpi_video0  intel_backlight
acpi_video0 is redundant and non-working.

Do you think should I set this platform to the dmi quirk? Or is there anyth=
ing
I could try to get rid of this?

Thanks.
