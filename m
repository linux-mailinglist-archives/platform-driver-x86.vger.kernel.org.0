Pretty sure the full atomic state is plumbed all the way
down these days.

I doubt anyone is going to care about a bit of overhead for a modeset.
The usual rule is that a modeset doesn't skip anything. That way we
can be 100% sure we remeber to update everythinbg. For fastsets I guess
one could argue skipping it if not needed, but not sure even that is
warranted.

The current code you have in there is cettainly 110% dodgy. Since the
sw_state is stored in the connector state I presume it's at least
trying to be an atomic property, which means you shouldn't go poking
at it after the swap_state ever. swap_state just swaps the pointers
which is all that you need. So at least that part should get nuked.
The immutable hw_state I guess should get updated when we program the
actual hw.
