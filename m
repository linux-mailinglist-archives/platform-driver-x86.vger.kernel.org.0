Note that pci_dev_check_d3cold() checks both the no_d3cold flag
(which tells whether the *driver* disabled D3cold) and the d3cold_allowed
flag (which tells whether *user space* disabled D3cold).

Basically right now we allow user space to override the driver setting,
which feels unsafe.  (Does user space always know better than the driver
whether D3cold can safely be entered?  I don't think so.)

Thanks,
