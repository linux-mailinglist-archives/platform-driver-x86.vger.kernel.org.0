It doesn't, except that the FIT, ACM, BootGuard, XuCode stuff rely on
their binaries to be there, this just sets the upper address limit of
the window.

No and a quick search didn't turn up anything. Can you point me to
resources about those SoCs? Also my module is targeting x86_64, that
is only a subset of x86 designs.

It doesn't matter where the firmware is coming from, as long as it is
_mapped_. And something has to be mapped there, even if it is just a
loader that gets eMMC going.
