While the choice of words are not correct, for me background is
important on why a feature is implemented.
Here even after ELC is implemented, majority of generations will still
not have this feature. Uncore is not just supported on TPMI systems.

There are so many features we have which improves perf/watt. Why ELC is
special needs some background.

Hardware. hardware always does this.

It is later. Hardware doesn't do a PM feature depending only on OS.

Yes in the patch.
