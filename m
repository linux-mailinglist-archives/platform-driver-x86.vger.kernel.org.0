It is in my best interest to not keep this discussion going and I
already asked a couple of times what hardware I could bind to on
tuesday. If there had been any constructive suggestion as to what I
could implement, I would already have done it. Andy only now pointed
out specifics about what could be the problem. Before that, the
reasons why my patch isn't welcome changed seemingly just to argue
against it and I was accused of trying to sneak something into the
kernel. Do you think I like to waste my and everyone's time like this?
Anyway, I am really tired of this and I nearly have wasted all my
holiday for this discussion, so I don't have any time and energy left
to finally implement the proper solution during this merge window.
