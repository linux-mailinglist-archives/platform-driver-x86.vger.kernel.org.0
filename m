I'm happy either way, but bear in mind that, due to the intrinsic
heterogeneous nature of MFD, I already have infrastructure to easily
apply (and send pull-requests for) cross-subsystem patch-sets.

If however, you decide that you'd really like to take the set, that's
also fine but I will require a pull-request from an immutable branch.
