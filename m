Big +1 from me for this proposal, I agree that having some userspace tool
to work with Windows compatible json files would be best here.

Again +1 / I agree where possible please try to fit things in the standardized
API, but as you can see from both the Dell and Lenovo sections in the API docs,
vendor extensions are allowed.
