Check MAXIMUS_VII_HERO by lock mutex directly

Could you check with updated patch? It has only nct6798d part and only for
check idea.

As I see by your logs and dsdt - all call returned just zero and DSDT does =
not
have RSIO/WRIO methods.

Could you please check with patch?

It looks as different for different boards, B550-E uses
"\\_SB.PCI0.SBRG.SIO1.MUT0" as mutex name.
