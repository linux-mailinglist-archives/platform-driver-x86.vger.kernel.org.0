YMC triggering works in 6.7, but not reliably in 6.8. So I assume the
culprit is e2ffcda16290.

But in theory debugfs, sysfs, acpi notify handler can race with each
other in the same way for 10+ years. Technically, probably not.

Yes, this is a real issue.

You can skip the third patch. The series compiles and works fine
without it.

Fine.

Thanks,
