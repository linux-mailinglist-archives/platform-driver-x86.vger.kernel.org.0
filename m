This really should be handled in ideapad-acpi, but that means figuring out a way
to find the touchpad device in ideapad-apci. For starters you can search for
ACPI devs which match:

static const struct acpi_device_id i2c_hid_acpi_match[] = {
        {"ACPI0C50", 0 },
        {"PNP0C50", 0 },
        { },
};

And then check if they have the TPRD/TPWR methods. This does risk piking
another device then the actual touchpad though, most likely a touchscreen
(in case where the ACPI tables accidentally also have TPRD/TPWR methods
on the touchscreen).

Once you have find the right ACPI device, we can call the methods
(when found) from:

ideapad_sync_touchpad_state()

Note that only ever reads the touchpad state...

Yes reading + logging (in dmesg) the BIOS interface version would be good.

Thank you for all your work on this!
