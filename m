The LED API actually has specific features which are typically
only used with kbd-backlights, such as the brightness_hw_changed
attribute which was specifically added to allow userspace to
monitor when a laptops embedded controller changes the kbd-backlight
brightness in response to a Fn + somekey hotkey keypress, so that
userspace can show an on-screen-display notification that the
kbd brightness has changed (like how it typically does for
audio volume changes too) and also showing the new brightness
level. See: Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-led for
the docs for the /sys/class/leds/<led>/brightness_hw_changed

So yes this very much is the standardized API for dealing with
kbd-backlights and has been so far years.

Just because you don't have a use for it does not mean that it
is not useful (and widely used) in cases where people use Linux
as a desktop OS, rather then for more embedded cases.

With USB-HID keyboards the LED class device will have the same HID-device
as parent as the input device. If there is no HID parent-device, then any
foo_kbd_backlight device will belong to the atkbd (PS/2) input-device.
