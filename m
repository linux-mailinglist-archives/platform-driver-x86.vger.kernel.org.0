As far as I know asusctl is the only (very) widely distributed and used tool for these laptops that uses the existing throttle_thermal_policy sysfs path, so it is very easy to sync asusctl with the changes made here.

2. is something which we may do in a year or so, we have a strict
no breaking userspace policy in the kernel; so people should be
able to drop in a new kernel without updating asusctl and things
should keep working. Which means that we are stuck with the
/sys/bus/platform/devices/asus-nb-wmi/throttle_thermal_policy
file for at least a year.

So we need to 1, call platform_profily_notify on writes
to /sys/bus/platform/devices/asus-nb-wmi/throttle_thermal_policy
and on changes because of the hotkey, while not calling it
from the profile_set callback.

Ah I see, yes I agree platform_profile_notify() should be called
from the store handler for /sys/bus/platform/devices/asus-nb-wmi/throttle_thermal_policy.

Basically it should be called for _all_ changes not done through
the profile_set callback.
