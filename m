I've amended the in-kernel SPDM implementation to expose signatures
received from the device in sysfs, together with all ancillary data
necessary to re-verify signatures from user space (transcript, hash
algorithm, etc).  It is also possible to set the next requester nonce
from user space if the kernel is mistrusted to always use a fresh nonce.

See the two top-most commits on this branch:

https://github.com/l1k/linux/commits/doe

I intend to submit these patches by end of June.  There are two things
still missing before I can resubmit:  Exposure of certificate chains in
sysfs (currently a WIP) and expiration of older signatures (to limit the
amount of memory consumed for their storage).  After submission, I intend
to forward-port your measurement patch in Q3.

I recall S3M folks rejected use of the in-kernel SPDM implementation for
SDSi because it previously didn't allow for re-verification of signatures
by user space.  Perhaps with the added functionality they'll reconsider?

Thanks,

Lukas
