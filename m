I think you have valid points both wrt the discoverability of the
feature availability, as well as about a "Charging inhibited" status
value possibly (likely) causing problems for userspace.

With that said, you really need to discuss this with Sebastian. I'm fine
with the thinkpad_acpi patches, but as I already said I want to avoid
in essence defining new power_supply class userspace API inside
drivers/platform/x86 .  Last time we did that it ended poorly and more
in general it is a bad idea.

So you first need to agree on a set of power_supply class sysfs attributes
for this and document those in the power_supply class docs, before I can
merge the thinkpad_acpi patches.

And the agreeing on and documenting is something which you need to discuss
with Sebastian (the power_supply maintainer).

Regards,

Hans
