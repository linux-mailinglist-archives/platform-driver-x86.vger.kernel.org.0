Ubuntu has a writeup on WMI here:
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Reference/WMI

And this looks interesting:
https://adamtheautomator.com/query-wmi-linux-python/

That seems to be just about querying and not about calling WMI
methods though.

Good luck with this. My own WMI experience is limited and I also
really don't have time to coach you on this. But perhaps someone
else on the list can help you further ?

Regards,

Hans
