No. Sorry I got it a little bit wrong above, I didn't know it exactly anymore 
and had to retest:


With the keyboard shortcut deactivated, xev on wayland shows this:

When I interpret the xkb-config correctly, JIS keyboards use the tilde 
scancode/keycode for the physical zenkaku/hankaku keys, at least in the default 
config HZTG (henkaku/zankaku toggle) is aliased to TLDE

At least from kernel side this would be a very small patch, are there any 
objections to it?

If not I make a patch for it and create a KDE issue.

kk will do later
