Hi Andy,

Failure to run your tool and include all the appropriate parties in
the review was an oversight on my part.  I will make sure it is done
in the following patches.

Regarding the statement  ...

      Please, be careful and read all comments you have been given and react
      to them either by explaining why it's not worth to address or with an
      addressed changes.

All other comments have been addressed in the commit notes and via
email.   The comments addressed were

- As a quick fix it's good, but have you had a chance to understand why
this failure happened in the first place?

- Can you check my theory that is expressed in the code below?
- Leverage ge2maintainer tool to include all appropriate parties.
(See earlier comment)

Did I address all the comments?  If not, please accept my apologies
and kindly point to the question(s) I need to address.

Regards,

Jorge
