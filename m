Thanks for improving the docs!  I do have a few overall comments,
though...

People give me grief when I take docs patches adding non-ascii characters.
Adding nearly 100 useless ® symbols seems likely to trigger that sort of
unicode aversion.  Can I ask you, please, to take those out?  There are
many occurrences of unadorned "Intel" in the kernel, and the world hasn't
ended yet.

The conventions for subsection markers are documented in
Documentation/doc-guide/sphinx.rst; this should be "========" rather than
hyphens.

This kind of stuff isn't going to render well in the built docs.  Can you
please change the literal text to literal blocks?  Something like:

	From the kernel tree, run the following commands::

		# cd tools/power/x86/intel-speed-select/
		# make
		# make install

Note the "::" on the first line; that introduces a literal block.  It would
be good to build the docs once you're done and be sure that you're happy
with the results.

There's a lot of these in this document.

Since this is meant to be a section header, please mark it as such;
"------" would be the appropriate marker for a header at this level.

That's enough for a first pass.

Thanks,
