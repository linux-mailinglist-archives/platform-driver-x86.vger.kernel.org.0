dev->no_d3cold appears to be mainly an administrative policy knob
twidded via sysfs.

There *are* a few cases where drivers (i915, nouveau, xhci) update it
via pci_d3cold_enable() or pci_d3cold_disable(), but they all look
vulnerable to issues if people use the sysfs knob, and I'm a little
dubious that they're legit in the first place.

This AMD Root Port issue is not an administrative choice; it's purely
a functional problem of the device advertising that it supports PME#
but not actually being able to do it.  So if we can do this by fixing
dev->pme_support (i.e., the copy of what it advertised), I'd rather do
that.
