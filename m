I see this driver has a lot of separate files, so what should happen here IMHO is:

1. a preparation patch adding a hp subdir moving the existing hp drivers there
2. but this driver in a subdir of the hp subdir, so put all its files under:

drivers/platform/x86/hp/hp-bioscfg

so as to keep the files together and separate from other hp drivers.

Note other then just skimming the comments I have not looked at this driver
at yet I will try to make time for this soon.

Mario, thank you for your review work on this.

Regards,

Hans
