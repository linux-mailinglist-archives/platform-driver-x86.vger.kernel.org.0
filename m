I already know from testing that there is zero negative effect on the coming MCU update and most users won't notice at all, but I would very much like to improve the current hack.

I'm totally fine with that.  As you have the asus-wmi patch based on 
those that worked best would you mind dropping it all together as a 
series to all 3 mailing lists (linux-pm/dri-devel/platform-x86?

I double checked and my 3 patches apply cleanly still on 6.12-rc2.

> One other consideration though is that I've found it pretty difficult to get some kind of safe HID request done through asus-wmi to fetch the MCU FW version and disable this quirk based on that, but I could possibly go in the other direction and have the hid-asus-* drivers find the asus-ally driver data and flip a switch to on/off these quirks. That would apply only for suspend/resume and not the reboot fix though.

I think once the hid-asus drivers land you can export a symbol that 
provides that information of the firmware version.  asus-wmi can have a 
dependency on those drivers and call that symbol and then make decisions 
on the quirks based on it.
