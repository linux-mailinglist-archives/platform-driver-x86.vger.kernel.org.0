The PMC is a single device (either ACPI or PCI) that includes SCU IPC
and zero or more child devices sharing the resources (hence I'm
converting it to MFD in the first place).

I want to use the same SCU IPC implementation from both the PCI driver
(intel_scu_pcidrv.c) and the MFD driver (intel_pmc_bxt.c).
