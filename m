I tried various keys in xdotool, and `xdotool key XF86Tools` opens 
Gnome's Settings application.  From what I can tell, KEY_CONFIG is 
mapped to that: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12228

There's also precedent in the Huawei laptop driver for using KEY_CONFIG:
https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/1024465/

For completeness, I'm adding further information about the hotkeys on 
the HP Omen 15 2020 (AMD), though the other keys are probably out of the 
scope of this patch.

---


Omen key:
* On Windows, brings up Omen command center
* hp-wmi: Unknown event_id - 29 - 0x21a5
* Since it's an unknown event, it's not sent via the event device.


Fn-Escape (unmarked):
* On Windows, triggers a small HP system info window.
* hp_wmi: Unknown event_id - 29 - 0x21a7
* My last HP (EliteBook 8530w from 2008) had Fn-Escape too, but I don't 
recall what it did in Linux.


Fn-F2 / Fn-F3 (backlight down/up):
* Sends proper events via ACPI Video. but also does something on atkbd:
* atkbd serio0: Unknown key released (translated set 2, code 0xab on 
isa0060/serio0).
* atkbd serio0: Use 'setkeycodes e02b <keycode>' to make it known.


Fn-F4 (keyboard backlight toggle):
* Toggle seems to happen in firmware
* Nothing on hp-wmi
* Nothing on any event devices


Fn-F11 (touchpad lock):
* Locking works (touchpad is frozen while LED is on)
* From unlocked: hp-wmi: Unknown key code - 0x21a9.  (LED turns on.)
* From locked:   hp-wmi: Unknown key code - 0x121a9  (LED turns off.)
* Sends EV_MSC/MSC_SCAN (value 0x21a9 or 0x121a9) to userspace.
* Sends EV_KEY/KEY_UNKNOWN down and up immediately (no hold or repeat).


Fn-F12 (windows key lock):
* No LED, but the lock works.
* From unlocked: hp-wmi: Unknown key code - 0x21a4  (Now locked.)
* From locked:   hp-wmi: Unknown key code - 0x121a4 (Now unlocked.)
* Sends EV_MSC/MSC_SCAN (value 0x21a4 or 0x121a4) to userspace.
* Sends EV_KEY/KEY_UNKNOWN down and up immediately (no hold or repeat).
