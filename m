You can silence that by also mapping 0xf0 to reserved in your hwdb changes.
Never mind I see you've already done this in your blogpost.

> Yes, all buttons (display & keyboard backlight up/down) works perfectly after this hwdb fix. Yes, I am going to open a pull request to systemd regarding this fix.

Great, thank you!
