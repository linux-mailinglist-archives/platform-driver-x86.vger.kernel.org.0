Unfortunately in the past the developers have not paid too much=20
attention to this difference so we're moving only (very) slowly towards=20
consistency.

You could add comment before the defines to tell which queries are known=20
to use those values. It would still be very much preferrable to have those=
=20
literals named so the code will become self-explanatory and those comments=
=20
wouldn't be neede anymore.
