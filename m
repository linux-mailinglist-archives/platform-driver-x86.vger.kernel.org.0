I think there is a misunderstanding here.

The WMAX WMI device is identical with the AWCC WMI device, only the UID might be different.
The reason why the thermal control WMI methods are not available on older WMAX devices is
that Dell seemed to have introduced this WMI methods after the usual WMAX WMI methods.

Because of this i advise against splitting WMAX (LED, attributes, ...) and AWCC functionality
into separate files.

I would rather split the drivers into:

- alienware-wmi-legacy, which handles the LEGACY WMI device and registers a alienware-wmi platform device

- alienware-wmi-wmax, which handles the modern WMAX WMI device and also registers a alienware-wmi platform device

- alienware-wmi-base, which provides a driver for the alienware-wmi platform device

This of course only works if the LEGACY WMI device and the WMAX WMI device are newer both present at the same time,
in this case alienware-wmi-legacy could use wmi_has_guid() as a band aid check to avoid probing if a WMAX WMI device
is present.

Using the platform_data mechanism to decouple the alienware-wmi device driver from the underlying hardware implementation
should be fine IMHO.

I know of at least one device which support both AWCC thermal control and
WMAX LED control, so splitting the WMAX device driver like this could cause
problems.

Like i said before, you should view the WMAX WMI device as having different
capabilities (= WMI methods) depending of the machine the kernel is running on.

If a capability is available (currently determined via quirks), the driver should
do the necessary things to handle it.

As a side note: i am currently exploring if we can decode the WMI BMOF buffers inside
the kernel, so that in the far future we can remove those quirks and automatically detect
which methods are available. But this will take a long time, so it has nothing to do with
this patch series.

I will take a look at the other patches tomorrow.

Thanks,
Armin Wolf
