Hi,

Somewhere between 28-11-2020 and today my brightness hotkeys are broken 
again. They act as mic mute key again. I don't know if this is caused by 
the system upgrade or something else. I have used windows for the first 
time in a while, so that may have sneakily upgraded something.

I have tried downgrading the packages linux, linux-headers, 
linux-firmware, systemd and systemd-libs (form Arch Linux) to some older 
version.

I also tried updating the bios from the bios screen and updating the 
firmware from windows device manager. This all didn't change anything.

So we're back where we started I guess.

Best regards,

Friso
