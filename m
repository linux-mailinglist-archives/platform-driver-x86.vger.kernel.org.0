I thought my last email was admitting that, but, if you insist, I
hereby explicitly admit, that, now, after some 40 emails, you have
brought forward a valid point that proves my assumption wrong. If this
is what makes you happy, then I can also certify my defeat on paper
and send it to you so you can hang it as a trophy on your wall. The
notion of being brave or not has no value for me here, I am purely
interested in the technical details. I never said that my solution was
brilliant, and, all I wanted, was, as you already know: to retain
functionality used by userspace tools on locked-down systems. Please,
next time, be of good character and don't play games like this. Just
directly bring forward the evidence to challenge an assumption.

Again, now, if you have the feeling that someone is blind, please
don't fool them around just to make them painfully aware of their
blind spot. IMO the more human solution is not to react with anger,
like you did, but with constructivism.
