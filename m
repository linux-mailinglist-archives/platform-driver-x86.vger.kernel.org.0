The checkpatch change submitter just picked one of the levels. They're=20

Hey, that code you're changing is not being submitted. We don't want to=20
waste our time on "fixing" checkpatch warnings on existing code when the=20
"fix" results in worse readability that before.

Also, if you would be submitting a patch and checkpatch suggest you=20
to make the patch worse, please don't follow checkpatch's advice even in=20
that case!

Checker tools are there to help find potential issues, not rulebooks. This=
=20
is often overlooked by many checker tool focused developers and results in=
=20
low quality patches (there are exceptions too where they developer really=
=20
tries to understand all the related code to see if the change makes sense=
=20
/ improves things or not).

Please stop trying to sneak your subpar change in.

NO, this a hard NO from the acting maintainer. We'll not be accepting=20
misguided changes that are to silence ANY checker that should have know=20
better (those checkers will never learn enough to be relied 100% so=20
please stop spreading such illusion).
