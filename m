Here is a link to the thread on the first patch set. The last notes I
saw were that it was going to be applied but it looks like that never
happened.

OOBMSM is an acronym for the Out-of-Band Management Services Module.
It is a PCIe function exposed by a device or CPU to provide in-band
telemetry.

Correct. In our case there will be multiple instances of each device
being potentially allocated.

Agreed. So we would set it up as an intel_pmt and then in the case of
crashlog we would be adding the binary sysfs for the memory access, a
trigger control, and the enable control. For the telemetry we would
just be adding the binary sysfs for the telemetry access. Do I have
all of that correct?

Okay.

Thanks.
