Hi Armin,
Really humbled and appreciate the depth of your review; though I have
now created a v3 of the patch (in a separate thread to try and give a
new "clean slate" to the patch) I did want to try and take the time to
respond to your comments and ensure that you and the PDX86 maintainers
feel like everything is really resolved in the best way possible. My
resolutions/comments inline below... !

Now (per your later comments) I have just completely removed all of
the Fan-related stuff from this driver which also includes hwmon, so
this depends should no longer even be present.

No reason other than it came over from copy-paste of other modules;
you are right, there is no value to read or change these after the
module loads (and maybe even could cause some issues) so I have
changed them all to 0.

Also done! I guess especially since in theory manufacturers should be
sticking to UEFI's ACPI / PNP ID registry that there should not be
risk that other devices would suddenly magically have the same ACPI
Device ID, so it feels quite safe to only rely on the ACPI device IDs
I would think.

This is done now as well, per other comments later in the thread. Note
I have not included i8042 changes in v3 of the patch but did see your
patch which will enable this; my thinking is that if your patch gets
merged to pdx86 for-next then I will go ahead and rebase to it and
then try to implement into a v4 of this patch (plus a comment about
the dependency in the commit msg), so we can actually fully remove the
global variable completely from the start with this driver.  Please
feel free to say if you had any other idea or preference on this!

I agree 100% with this and have removed all of the fan stuff from this
driver. I will see if I can kick something off with the ACPI folks and
make some progress there as I have some time.

For my specific device I will also try to push this as a bug with
Samsung, as there is a bug in the DSDT of my device which throws an
exception when you try to execute _FST on the fan device if the state
control / speed is greater than 0. I have been able to patch my DSDT
to fix the exception but this is not a super user-friendly process and
will potentially create havoc if I upgrade my BIOS later and I think
this is not a great process for end users to have to put up with :)

ACPI_NOTIFY_BATTERY_STATE_CHANGED = notification that battery has
changed state (not 100% what all cases but it is definitely every time
that charging is stopped due to meeting charge control end threshold,
and have seen it (somewhat intermittently, it feels like?) when
connecting or disconnecting the power adapter etc)

ACPI_NOTIFY_DEVICE_ON_TABLE = notification when the motion sensor in
the device detects that the device has been placed on a flat surface /
a "table"

ACPI_NOTIFY_DEVICE_OFF_TABLE = notification when the motion sensor in
the device detects that the device has been removed from a flat
surface / a "table"

ACPI_NOTIFY_HOTKEY_PERFORMANCE_MODE is semi-obvious I guess :) But in
the logic there is currently a case where if "performance_mode" is
enabled then it will swallow this key event and then execute the
action to cycle the profile, but if "performance_mode" is disabled
then it will not swallow the event but will instead send the key event
to the input device. Does this make sense or should it just be removed
from the keymap entirely?

Removed all of this most of the logging in the driver; created a new
tracepoint with a new trace system called samsung_galaxybook and moved
this ACPI communication tracing there, and then switched anything left
in the driver itself to dev_* version of functions (but only some
dbg/warn/errors are left). Hopefully how I set up the header file and
the tracepoint system and event all looks as it should but any
feedback is welcome on any part of this!

Yes, removed all of the fan stuff :)

Changed len to size_t but for now I have left purpose_str in because
it helps me a lot with the traces in case any users have an issue and
need to provide a trace file (since this is a very chatty device
especially during init, and the payloads can be really long.. it is
easy to get a bit lost without some info in the trace to help navigate
what is supposed to be happening). Is it ok to have it for this usage
or is there any other preferred/better way to try and send this kind
of information in the traces?

Now I have combined the first two cases and have it returning
ETOOSMALL (best guess I could come to for this based on the various
errno lists) but for the second two I was not really sure what
specific error code would fit best there (missing success code vs
existence of error code in response payload). So I have left them as
EIO and write a dev_err() for them but please feel free say if there
are specific error codes that should represent these kind of cases (as
I could not find anything too obvious in the few different lists I
managed to find..).

Here I have redone this a bit so that only ints with valid error codes
are always returned, but in several cases there is an ACPI failure
given that I need to then provide an int error code, so I have tried
to choose a reasonable int error code to return in all of these cases
but please feel free to suggest if anything looks off!

Here I have now added locking within galaxybook_acpi_method itself, so
it always locks on galaxybook->acpi_lock for anything that will be
working with the ACPI device (calling various methods etc). Does this
work ok for handling locks from when the i8042 keyboard filters
triggers actions (which will then execute acpi methods and make use of
this acpi_lock) or should this be done a bit differently outside of
that method instead? (e.g. is it also / more important to lock on
updating the brightness value itself and/or when executing
led_classdev_notify_brightness_hw_changed() etc ? or is it reasonable
to say that locking within the acpi method function anyway will take
care of any issue that could happen here?)

Then for notification to the new input device via the sparse keymap I
have also added another lock galaxybook->input_lock

Thanks for this catch! This was leftover from when I had some extra
debug printing here before returning but now I have hopefully cleaned
this up here as well as all other similar instances.

Done, but I used `":" LED_FUNCTION_KBD_BACKLIGHT` so that the
resulting name will be "samsung-galaxybook::kbd_backlight", hopefully
this seems ok?

Done and also tried to ensure usage of devres/devm_* functions and/or
at least trigger a devm_add_action_or_reset() to remove instead of
handling it in the driver remove -- please say if it looks I missed
anything :)

As mentioned, agree 100% on this and have taken it out completely
(including the hwmon device). Very good link as well from Microsoft
which I think will provide good support for having this in the Linux
driver, as well (that there are likely many other devices in the wild
that have the exact condition as these Samsung devices, since their
goal was only to provide support in Windows).

Here I think there is maybe a discrepancy with what was said by Hans:
https://lore.kernel.org/platform-driver-x86/40b82b39-3bba-4eac-8eb0-b4cee4868737@redhat.com/

As I understand from his comment that the desire is to handle this
"like the EC performs the action" and then just give the built-in
notification i.e. led_classdev_notify_brightness_hw_changed (and no
key event) to avoid risk that people will "accidentally" create double
events or loops etc.

For now I have tried to achieve what I took from Han's reply (swallow
the event and do the action, but then send the hw notification) but if
this should be changed then I can do whatever is most appropriate.

Regarding locking, do you think the acpi_lock here within
galaxybook_acpi_method will cover this in a good way or anything else
should be done specifically here?

Regarding the keycode do you mean that this should send something to
the input device via the sparse keymap or that the i8042 filter should
emit a key event, or? And/or that it could be handled with a hwdb
update in systemd so that this key gets mapped to the right event?

Regarding the specific keycode I assume that maybe the appropriate one
would be KEY_CAMERA_ACCESS_TOGGLE ? (though I have not seen any OSD
notification with this keycode but maybe it was only with older
versions of userspace tools I was originally testing this with..).

Here I took the same approach (swallow the key event "like it was
handled by the EC" and don't send a key event that would allow for
double events) but there is no built-in hw event for this from what I
can see. But I would say it is related to the comment above -- how
should this actually work? (e.g. send KEY_CAMERA_ACCESS_TOGGLE via
sparse keymap to the input device instead of letting the event pass
through to the AT keyboard device i.e. return true to filter out the
event in the i8042 filter) ?

Here I have added both a mutex lock (input_lock) that wrapped the
sparse_keymap_report_event plus I have added
acpi_bus_generate_netlink_event() -- took some liberties with the
names to pass to the event (DRIVER_NAME and then the ACPI Device ID)
if these look ok? Tested with acpid and it did look ok but I could not
see any clear standard on what to use for these labels.

Here I have changed the "visibility" to use is_visible with a function
per your first suggestion, but as I needed things in this is_visible
to call the ACPI methods then I needed to control exactly when they
ran.. so I have not added them to .dev_groups of the driver but
instead added them in the probe function after the ACPI device is
setup and initialized (using devm_device_add_group()) -- does this
seem ok?

Based on this I have just completely removed the
performance_mode_hotkey_work queue and just directly call the function
here within galaxybook_acpi_notify. I noticed in the tracepoint trace
that every execution of this action from the hotkey is in fact
happening in a separate thread so that seems as desired, but please
let me know if anything seems off with this now!

There is no longer a workqueue associated with the input device (per
previous comments) so hopefully this part is no longer valid. I have
also revamped a bit of the flow of this and baked a lot of it into the
function galaxybook_acpi_init() -- please take a look and see if it
looks ok/better now and/or if there is more work to be done on this?

Now I have changed this so that they are both handled via devm
functions; I think this order should be achieved but in case I missed
something then please feel free to say!
