I quote the following from Armin:

The former part is not met here.

It's a driver for Legion Go and Legion laptops. _Not_ those
interfaces. Which only exist in gen 7+ if I recall from John's driver.
That was my comment.

Establishing an ABI that works with older laptops and laptops that
supersede those interfaces would be beneficial I'd say.

Call the probe function that can -ENODEV

Hm, for some reason I missed the capability block when doing my RE
[1]. Feel free to reference when making the driver.

You should also provision for the fact some legion laptops have an
extreme mode which is stubbed on the Legion Go

Ok,
let's wrap up this discussion and put a bow on it.

I currently have two issues that block me from committing to your
driver: novel use of kernel APIs/design and performance
degradation/instability from unnecessary calls and checks, as those
are (i) slower (ii) could error out (iii) could have incorrect data.

The former can leave me with tech debt if your proposed ABI is vetoed
and the latter would result in a degraded experience for my users; I
would be putting in work to go backwards. I do not mention missing
features, as that is something I could have also worked on if I
committed to your driver.

Therefore, I'm left in a situation where I have to wait for buy-in
from kernel maintainers and for your V2, hoping it fixes the latter
issue which you said it will only do partly.

Best,
Antheas
