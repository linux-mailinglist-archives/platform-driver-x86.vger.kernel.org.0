Hi Hans,

Sorry, I didn't realize the CPUID is not added to rc1. Our internal
tree constantly gets rebased. So difficult to catch.

As you rule, I will communicate internally that apply on top of 
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/pdx86/platform-drivers-x86.git/log/?h=for-next
 
If doesn't build atleast add that to the patch notes.

BTW, I send my PULL from this tree and branch always.

Thanks,
Srinivas
