You are reaching the wrong conclusion I feel?

a) your proposal doesn't address that ACPI and the upstream board configu=
re all this stuff already.
We are creating duplicate devices right now. Patch 1 removes the duplicat=
e device. I don't see that
your proposal addresses the duplicate devices?

b) there is no reason for naming to be different between APU2-4 and 5. Le=
ts standardise. I use the
boards somewhat interchangeably

c) If you check my patch, there is already a DMI match for APU5, so this =
can do whatever you want it
to, however, since it's green fields, I've set it up to match the way APU=
2-4 is working (in my patch)

d) Your driver already broke my userspace a year back when you changed th=
ese names. I've just
supported all/both versions of the LED naming conventions since then (it =
isn't hard). I do believe
we are overthinking this? It's really trivial to incorporate?

Knock yourself out. However, make sure that you read Pascal's email to yo=
u where he states that
these lines aren't actually wired up on many of the board revisions?

The APU2-4 have

- 3x mpcie *shaped* slots

- On some boards there are two of these wired with the pcie signals

- On some boards there are two or three of these wired with USB signals

- On some boards there are mSATA signals to one of these slots

- On some boards there are either 1x or 2x SIM cards wired to some of the=
 slots


What is common is that the reset lines (and rfkill) go to the same slots =
as the SIM lines.

So my suggestion is to name these lines based on "purpose", ie modem1 and=
 modem2, which is 100%
consistent, rather than slot number, since that varies based on which boa=
rd you pickup off the pile


The schematics are all publicly available. Although I think you may have =
to ask Pascal for the
APU5/6 ones. The rest are on the website


I'm confused about what you mean by M2 slot? There are no m.2 slots on th=
e board? only mpcie, some
with USB signals, some with SIM?

Please read Pascal's email to you. He disconnected these lines on many bo=
ard revisions.

We just need the GPIOs exposing in some way. Nothing else. Everything els=

Lets please focus on things we can achieve in the near future in this thr=

Not disagreeing, but it seems about as reliable as doing a software upgra=

you are likely safe doing this

I've already got one

I'm hiring. Contact me offlist if you want to talk further?

Realistically that's only partially true:

- older kernels and older bios has "old names"

- kernels from a year back with your driver have a mix of "new" or "new +=
 old" names depending on
whether the bios is newer than 4.10.

- After the patch I proposed: newer bios and newer kernel use ACPI, older=
 bios match your driver,
people upgrading from kernels more than about a year old don't notice sin=
ce they move from "old"
names to "acpi names" which are identical.

Not experimental. Works reliably. Just don't toggle them during bootup (a=
s your driver was doing in
the past - current driver doesn't do this anymore - problem resolved)

The GPIO lines are wired to a SIM swap chip which does all the work. The =
LTE cards don't know or see
what is happening
